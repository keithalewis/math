Probability Theory is an extension of the rules of logic to deal with uncertain events.
A probability is a number between 0 and 1 representing a degree of belief.
All probabilities are conditional and can be systematically
updated as more information becomes available.

## Probability Space

A _sample space_ $Ω$ is the set of what can happen.
An _outcome_ $ω\in Ω$ is an element of a sample space.
An _event_ $E\subseteq Ω$ is a subset of a sample space.
An _algebra_ $\AA$ is collection of events that is closed under set complement and union.
If it is also closed under countable unions of events then is it a $σ$-algebra.
We assume the empty set belongs to each algebra.

__Exercise__. _Show $Ω\in\AA$ and $\AA$ is closed under set intersection_.

_Hint_: Use De Morgan's laws.

Algebras model _partial information_.

### Atom, Partition

If $\AA$ is finite then the _atoms_ of an algebra are a _partition_ of its sample space
and $\AA$ is the smallest algebra generated by its atoms.

An atom is an event $A\in\AA$ where $B\subseteq A$ for some $B\in\AA$
implies $B=\emptyset$ or $B=A$.  If $\AA$ is finite and $ω\in Ω$ define
${A_ω = \cap\{A\in\AA\mid ω\in A\}}$.

__Exercise__. _Show $A_ω$ is the atom of $\AA$ containing $ω\in Ω$_.

__Excercise__. _Show $\{A_ω\mid ω\in Ω\}$ is a partition of $Ω$_.

_Hint_: Since $ω\in A_ω$, $ω\in Ω$, the union is $Ω$.
Show either $A_ω = A_{ω'}$ or ${A_ω \cap A_{ω'} = \emptyset}$, $ω,ω'\in Ω$.

If $\AA$ is finite then we can identify it with its atoms.

_Partial information_ is modeled by a partition of a sample space.
Complete information corresponds to the _finest_ partition
$\{\{ω\}\mid ω\in Ω\}$.
No information corresponds to the _coarsest_ partition $\{Ω\}$.
Partial information is knowing only which set in the partition an
outcome belongs to.

### Measure

A _measure_ is a set function $μ\colon\AA\to\RR$ that
satisfies $μ(E\cup F) = μ(E) + μ(F) - μ(E\cap F)$ for $E,F\in\AA$.
Measures do not count things twice.
We also assume $μ(\emptyset) = 0$. The measure of nothing is 0.
Measures assign a set to a number.

__Exercise__ _Show $μ(E\cup F) = μ(E) + μ(F)$ if $E\cap F=\emptyset$_.

A _probability measure_ is a measure with $P(E)\ge0$ for all $E\in\AA$
and $P(Ω) = 1$.

#### Discrete

If $Ω = \{ω_j\}$ is finite (or countable) we can define a _discrete_ probability
measure by $P(\{ω_j\}) = p_j$ where $p_j\ge0$ and $\sum_j p_j = 1$.

__Exercise__. _Show $P(E) = \sum_{ω_j\in E} p_j$_.

_Hint_. $E$ is the disjoint union of singletons $\{ω_j\}$ where $ω_j\in E$.

#### Coin tossing

We can model a sequence of random coin flips by a sequence of 0's and 1's where
0 corresponds to heads and 1 corresponds to tails. (Or vice versa.)
If $ω_j\in\{0,1\}$ is the $j$-th flip define
${ω = \sum_{j=1}^\infty ω_j/2^j}$.

__Exercise__. _Show $ω\in [0,1)$_.

__Exercise__. _Show if $ω_1 = 0$ then $ω\in [0,1/2)$ and if $ω_1 = 1$ then $ω\in [1/2,1)$_.

This shows the partition $\AA_1 = \{[0,1/2), [1/2,1)\}$ of $[0, 1)$ represents knowing
the first base 2 digit of $ω$. Similarly, the partition
$\AA_2 = \{[0,1/4), [1/4, 1/2), [1/2, 3/4), [3/4,1)\}$ represents knowing the
first two base 2 digits of $ω$.

__Exercise__. _Show the partition $\AA_n = \{[j/2^n, (j + 1)/2^n)\mid 0\le j < 2^n\}$
of $[0, 1)$ represents knowing the first $n$ base 2 digits of $ω\in [0,1)$_.

## Random Variable

A _random variable_ on a probability space $\langle Ω, P, \AA\rangle$
is an _$\AA$-measurable_ function $X\colon Ω\to\RR$.
If $\AA$ is finite we write $X\colon \AA\to\RR$.

__Exercise__. _If $\AA$ is finite then $X$ is a function on its atoms._

_Hint_: $X\colon Ω\to\RR$ is $\AA$-measurable if and only if
$\{ω\in Ω\mid X(ω) \le x\}\in\AA$, $x\in\RR$.

Random variables are symbols that can be used in place of a number when
manipulating equations and inequalities. A _statistic_ is
a function of random variable.

The cdf tells you everything there is to know about the probability of
the values a random variable can take on.

Its _cumulative distribution function_ is ${F(x) = F_X(x) = P(X\le x) = P(\{ω\in Ω\mid X(ω) \le x\})}$.
More generally, given a subset $A\subseteq\mathbf{R}$ the probability that
$X$ takes a value in $A$ is $P(X\in A) = P(\{ω\in Ω\mid X(ω)\in A\}$.
The cdf corresponds to $A = (-\infty, x]$.
Two random variables have the same _law_ when they have the same cdf.

__Exercise__. _Show $P(a < X \le b) = F(b) - F(a)$_. 

Every cdf is non-decreasing, continuous from the right, has left limits, and
$\lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x) = 0$, $\lim_{x\to+\infty}F(x) = 1$.
Any function with these properties is the cdf of a random variable.

__Exercise__: _Show $F(x) \le F(y)$ if $x < y$_.

_Hint_: $(-\infty, x] \subset (-\infty, y]$ if $x < y$ and $P(x < X \le y) \ge 0$.

__Exercise__: _Show $\lim_{y\downarrow x} F(y) = F(x)$_.

_Hint_: $\cap_{n=1}^\infty (-\infty, x + 1/n] = (-\infty, x]$.

__Exercise__: _Show $\lim_{y\uparrow x} F(y) = F(x-)$ exists_.

_Hint_: If $y_n$ is an increasing sequence with limit $x$
then $F(y_n)$ is a non-decreasing sequence bounded by $F(x)$
so $sup_n F(y_n)$ exists and is not greater than $F(x)$.

__Exercise__. _Show $\lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x) = 0$_.

_Hint_ $\cap_n (-\infty, -n] = \emptyset$.

__Exercise__. _Show $\lim_{x\to\infty}F(x) = 1$_.

_Hint_ $\cup_n (-\infty, n] = (-\infty, \infty)$.

In general $P(X\in A) = \int_A dF(x)$
for sufficiently nice subsets $A\subset\mathbf{R}$ using
[Riemann–Stieltjes](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/StieltjesIntegral.html)
integration.

## Uniform

A _uniformly distributed_ random variable $U$ on $[0,1)$
has cdf $F(x) = x$ if $0\le x\le 1$, $F(x) = 0$ if $x < 0$, and $F(x) = 1$ if $x > 1$.

__Exercise__. _If $X$ has cdf $F$, then $X$ and $F^{-1}(U)$ have the same law_.

_Hint_: If $F(x)$ jumps from $a$ to $b$ at $x = c$ we define $F^{-1}(u) = c$ for $a \le u < b$.

__Exercise__. _If $X$ has cdf $F$, then $F(X)$ and $U$ have the same law_.

This shows a uniformly distributed random variable has sufficient randomness to
generate any random variable. There are no random, random variables.

Given a cdf $F$ we can define a random variable having that law
using the identity function $X\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R}$, where $X(x) = x$.
Let $P$ be the probability measure on $\mathbf{R}$ defined by
$P(A) = \int_A dF(x)$. 

### Continuous Random Variable

If the cdf satisfies $F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x F'(u)\,du$ we say the random variable
is _continuously distributed_. The _density function_ is $f = F'$.
Any function satisfying $f\ge 0$ and $\int_\mathbf{R} f(x)\,dx = 1$
is a density function for a random variable.

__Exercise__. _If $X$ is continuously distributed show
$P(a < X \le b) = P(a \le X \le b) = P(a \le X < b) = P(a \le X \le b)$_.

### Discrete Random Variable

If the set $\{ω\in Ω\mid X(ω) \not= 0, P(\{ω\}) \not=0\}$ is countable then
$X$ is _discretely distributed_. If the non-zero values are
$\{x_j\}$ occuring at $\{ω_j\}$ then $p_j = P(\{ω_j\})$ determine $X$.

### Expected Value

The _expected value_ of a random variable is defined by
$E[X] = \int_ Ω X\,dP$. More generally, the expected value of
a function $f\colon\RR\to\RR$ of
a random variable is $E[f(X)] = \int_ Ω f(X)\,dP$
where $f(X)\colon Ω\to\RR$ via $f(X)(ω) = f(X(ω))$, $ω\in Ω$.

The _variance_ of a random variable $X$ is $\Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]= E[X^2] - E[X]^2$.

__Lemma__. (Chebyshev) _If $f$ is non-negative then $P(f(X) > \lambda) \le E[f(X)]/\lambda$_.

_Proof_. We have $E[f(X)] \ge E[f(X)1(f(X) > \lambda) \ge \lambda P(f(X) > \lambda)$.

An immediate corollaries are $P(|X| > \lambda) \le E[|X|]/\lambda$ and
$P(|X - E[X]| > \lambda) \le \Var(X)/\lambda^2$. Note this only
has import for large $\lambda$.

### Moments

The _moments_ of a random variable are $\mu_n = E[X^n]$ where $n$ is a non-negative integer.
The _moment generating function_ is $\mu(s) = E[e^{sX}] = \sum_{n=0}^\infty m_n s^n/n!$.
Note $\mu^{(n)}(0) = m_n$.

Moments don't necessarily exist for all $n$, except for $n = 0$.
They also cannot be an arbitrary sequence of values.

Suppose all moments of $X$ exist, then for any complex numbers,
$(c_i)$, $0 \le E|\sum_i c_i X^i|^2 = E\sum_{j,k} c_j\bar{c_k} X^{j+k}
= \sum_{j,k} c_j \bar{c_k} m_{j+k}$.  This says the Hankel matrix, $M =
[m_{j+k}]_{j,k}$, is positive definite.  The converse is also true: if
the Hankel matrix is positive definite there exists a random variable
with the corresponding moments.  This is not a trivial result and the
random variable might not be unique.

### Cumulant

The _cumulant_ of $X$ is the natural logarithm of its moment
generating function $\kappa(s) = \log E[e^sX]$.

__Exercise__. _Show $κ_X(0) = 0$, $κ_X'(0) = E[X]$, and $κ_X''(0) = \Var(X)$_.

__Exercise__. _Show if $c$ is a constant then $κ_{c + X}(s) = cs + κ_X(s)$_.

__Exercise__. _Show if $c$ is a constant then $κ_{cX}(s) = κ_X(cs)$_.

__Exercise__. _Show if $X$ and $Y$ are independent then $κ_{X + Y}(s) = κ_X(s) + κ_Y(s)$_.

The _cumulants_ $(κ_n)$ are the coefficients of the power series expansion
$κ(s) = \sum_{n>0}κ_n s^n/n!$.

__Exercise__. _Show $κ_1 = E[X]$ and $κ_2 = \mathrm{Var}(X)$_.

The third and fourth cumulants are related to skew and kurtosis.
If the variance is 1, then $κ_3$ is the skew and $κ_4$ is the
[excess kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis#Excess_kurtosis).

__Exercise__. _Show $κ_1(c + X) = c + κ_1(X)$ and  $κ_n(c + X) = κ_n(X)$, $n \ge 2$_.

__Exercise__. _Show $κ_n(cX) = c^n κ_n(X)$ for all $n$_, $n\ge 1$.

__Exercise__. _Show if $X$ and $Y$ are independent $κ_n(X + Y) = κ_n(X) + κ_n(Y)$ for all $n$_.

The moments of $X$, $\mu_n = E[X^n]$ are related
to the cumulants via complete Bell polynomials $B_n(κ_1,\ldots,κ_n)$.
$$
	E[e^{sX}] = \sum_{n\ge0} \mu_n s^n/n! = e^{κ(s)} = e^{\sum_{n>0} κ_n s^n/n!}
	= \sum_{n\ge0} B_n(κ_1,\ldots,κ_n) s^n/n!
$$
Taking a derivative with respect to $s$ of the last equality gives the recurrence formula
$$
	B_0 = 1, B_{n+1}(κ_1,\ldots,κ_{n+1})
		= \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} B_{n - k}(κ_1,\ldots,κ_{n-k})κ_{k + 1}, n > 0.
$$

The cumulants are related to the moments via partial Bell polynomials $B_{n,k}(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_{n - k - 1}$
$$
	κ_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k k! B_{n,k+1}(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_{n - k})
$$
where $(B_{n,k})$ are partial Bell polynomials satisfying the recurrence
$B_{0,0} = 1$, $B_{n,0} = 0$ for $n > 0$, $B_{0,k} = 0$ for $k > 0$ and
$$
	B_{n,k}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n - k + 1})
		= \sum_{i=1}^{n-k+1}\binom{n-1}{i - 1} B_{n-i,k-1}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n - i - k + 2})x_i
$$

## Jensen's Inequality

A function $\phi\colon\RR\to\RR$ is _convex_ if $\phi(x) = \sup_{\lambda\le\phi} \lambda(x)$
and _concave_ if $\phi(x) = \inf_{\lambda\ge\phi} \lambda(x)$
where $\lambda$ is linear.

__Exercise__. _If $\phi$ is convex then $\phi(tx + (1 - t)x') \le t\phi(x) + (1 - t)\phi(x')$
if $0\le t\le 1$_.

Hint: $\lambda(x) = \phi(x^*) + m(x - x^*) \le \phi(x)$ where $x^* = t\phi(x) + (1 - t)\phi(x')$
and $m = (\phi(x') - \phi(x))/(x' - x)$.

__Theorem__. _If $\phi$ is convex then $E[\phi(X)] \ge \phi(E[X])$_.

For $\lambda\le\phi$ linear we have $E[\phi(X)] \ge E[\lambda(X)] = \lambda(E[X])$.

### Convergence

Random variables $X_n$ converge to $X$ in _mean_ if
$E[|X_n - X|]$ converges to 0. They converges in _mean square_ if
$\Var(X_n - X)$ converges to 0.
They converges _in probability_ if for all $\epsilon > 0$ it is evenually
the case that $P(|X_n - X|) > \epsilon) < \epsilon$.
They converge _almost surely_ if $P(\lim_n X_n = X) = 1$.

__Lemma__. (Chebyshev) _For any non-negative random variable $X$, $P(X > \lambda) \le E[X]/\lambda$_.

_Proof_. $E[X] \ge E[X 1(X > \lambda)] \ge \lambda P(X > \lambda)$.

__Exercise__. _For any non-negative random variable $X$ and any increasing function $\phi$,
$P(X > \lambda) \le E[\phi(X)]/\phi(\lambda)$_.

__Exercise__. _If $X_n$ converges in mean square then it converges in probability_.

Hint: $\phi(x) = x^2$ is increasing for $x > 0$.

## Joint Distribution

Two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, are defined by their _joint
distribution_, $H(x,y) = P(X\le x, Y\le y)$.  For example, the point $(X,Y)$ is
in the square $(a,b]\times (c,d]$ with probability
$P(a < X \le b, c < Y \le d) = P(X \le b, Y \le d) - P(X \le a) - P(Y \le c) + P(X \le a, Y \le c)$.

The _marginal distbutions_ are $F(x) = H(x,\infty)$ and $G(y) =  H(\infty,y)$,
where $F$ and $G$ are the cumulative distributions of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.

In general, the joint distribution of $X_1$, \ldots, $X_n$ is
$F(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = P(X_1\le x_1,\ldots, X_n\le x_n$).


## Examples

See ...

### Uniform

A random variable is uniformly distributed on the interval $[a, b)$ has density function
$f(x) = (x - a)/(b - a)$ if $a \le x \le b$ and $f(x) = 0$ if $x < a$ or $x > b$.

__Exercise__. _Show if $U$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ then $a(1 - U) + bU$
is uniformly distributed on $[a, b]$_.

### Cantor

Let's define a function on the interval $[0,1]$ as follows.
Every $x\in[0,1]$ can be written $x = \sum_{j>0} x_j/3^j$ where $x_j\in\{0,1,2\}$
The digits $(x_j)$ are the base 3 representaton of $x$. Define $F(x) = ???$

We have $F(0) = 0$, $F(1) = 1$, and $F$ is continuous...

The measure of the set where $F' = 0$ is 1.

### Measurable

A function $X\colon Ω\to\mathbf{R}$ is _measurable_ with respect to the algebra $\mathcal{A}$
if $\{ω\in Ω : X(ω) \le a\}$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$ for all $a\in\mathbf{R}$.

__Exercise__. _Show $X$ is measurable if and only if it is constant on atoms of $\mathcal{A}$
when the algebra has a finite number of elements._

In this case we can write $X\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathbf{R}$ as a function on the
atoms of $\mathcal{A}$.

%Exercise. (Inclusion-Exclusion principal) Let $S$ be a finite set and
%let $f$ be any function defined on subsets of $S$.
%Define $\phi f(T) = \sum_{U\supseteq T} f(U)$ and
%$\psi g(T) = \sum_{U\supseteq T} (-1)^{|U| - |T|} g(T)$.
%These are both operators from $2^S\to\mathbf{R}$.
%Show $\phi\psi g = g$ and $\psi\phi f = f$.

%Hint: Group the sum by $|Y| - |T|$.

## Conditional Expectation

The _conditional expectation_ of an event $B$ given an event $A$ is
$P(B|A) = P(B\cap A)/P(A)$. In some sense, this reduces the sample space to $A$
since $P(A|A) = 1$ and $P(B\cup C|A) = P(B|A) + P(C|A) - P(B\cap C|A)$.
We also have $P(A|B) = P(A\cap B)/P(B)$ so $P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)$. 
This is the simplest form of Bayes Theorem. It shows how to update your degree
of belief based on new information. Every probability is conditional on information.

Define the conditional expectation of the random variable $X$ with respect
to the event $A$ by $E[X|A] = E[X 1_A]/P(A)$.  If $X = 1_B$ then
this coincides with the definition of conditional expectation above.

Define the conditional expectation of $X$ with respect to the algebra
$\mathcal{A}$, $E[X|\mathcal{A}]:\mathcal{A}\to\mathbf{R}$, by
$E[X|\mathcal{A}](A) = E[X|A]$ for $A$ an atom of $\mathcal{A}$.

## Joint Distribution

Two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, are defined by their _joint
distribution_, $H(x,y) = P(X\le x, Y\le y)$.  For example, the point $(X,Y)$ is
in the square $(a,b]\times (c,d]$ with probability
$P(a < X \le b, c < Y \le d) = P(X \le b, Y \le d) - P(X \le a) - P(Y \le c) + P(X \le a, Y \le c)$.

The _marginal distbutions_ are $F(x) = H(x,\infty)$ and $G(y) =  H(\infty,y)$,
where $F$ and $G$ are the cumulative distributions of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.

In general, the joint distribution of $X_1$, \ldots, $X_n$ is
$F(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = P(X_1\le x_1,\ldots, X_n\le x_n$).

## Independent

The random variables $X$ and $Y$ are _independent_ if $H(x,y) = F(x)G(y)$ for all $x$ and $y$.
This is equivalent to $P(X\in A,Y\in B) = P(X\in A)P(Y\in B)$ for any sets $A$ and $B$.

We also have that $Ef(X)g(Y) = Ef(X) Eg(Y)$ for any functions $f$ and $g$ whenever all expected
values exist.

__Exercise__: Prove this for the case $f = \sum_i a_i 1_{A_i}$ and $g = \sum_j b_j 1_{B_j}$.

In general, $X_1$, \ldots, $X_n$ are independent if
$F(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = F_1(x_1)\cdots F_n(x_n)$, where $F_j$ is the law of $X_j$.

## Copula

A _copula_ is the joint distribution of uniformly distributed random variables on the unit interval.
The copula of $X$ and $Y$ is the joint distribution of $F^{-1}(X)$ and $G^{-1}(Y)$ where
$F$ and $G$ are the cumulative distributions of $X$ and $Y$ respectively:
$C(u,v) = C^{X,Y}(u,v) = P(F^{-1}(X) \le u, G^{-1}(Y) \le v)$.

__Exercise__: Show $C(u,v) = H(F(u),G(v))$ where
and $H$ is the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ and $F$ and $G$ are the cumulative
distribution of $X$, and $Y$.

__Exercise__: Show $H(x,y) = C(F^{-1}(x), G^{-1}(y))$

This shows how to use the copula and marginal distributions to recover the joint distribution.

An equivalent definition is a copula is a probability measure on $[0,1]^2$ with uniform
marginals. 

__Exercise__: Prove this.

If $U$ and $V$ are independent, uniformly distributed random variables on the unit interval
then $C(u,v) = uv$.

If $V=U$ then their joint distribution is
$C(u,v) = P(U\le u, V\le v) = P(U\le u, U\le v) = P(U\le \min\{u, v\}) = \min\{u,v\} = M(u,v)$.

If $V=1-U$ then their joint distribution is $C(u,v) = P(U\le u, V\le v) = P(U\le u, 1-U\le v)
= P(1-v\le U\le u) = \max\{u - (1 -v), 0\} = \max\{u + v - 1, 0\} = W(u,v)$

__Exercise__: (Fr&#233;chet-Hoeffding) For every copula, $C$, $W \le C \le M$.

Hint: For the upper bound use $H(x,y) \le F(x)$ and $H(x,y) \le G(y)$.
For the lower bound note $0\le C(u_1,v_1) - C(u_1, v_2) - C(u_2, v_1) + C(u_2, v_2)$
for $u_1 \ge u_2$ and $v_1 \ge v_2$.

## Examples

### Discrete

A _discrete_ random variable, $X$, is defined by
$x_i\in\mathbf{R}$ and $p_i > 0$ with $\sum p_i = 1$.
The probability the random variable takes on value $x_i$ is P(X = x_i) = $p_i$.

If a discrete random variable takes on a finite number of values, $n$, then
if $p_i = 1/n$ for all $i$ the variable is called _discrete uniform_.

### Bernoulli

A _Bernoulli_ random variable is a discrete random variable with $P(X = 0) = p$, $P(X = 1) = 1 - p$.

### Binomial

A _Binomial_ random variable is a discrete random variable with
$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$, $k = 0$, \ldots, $n$.

### Uniform

A _continuous uniform_ random variable on the interval $[a,b]$ has density
$f(x) = 1_{[a,b]}/(b - a)$.

A _discrete uniform_ random variable on $ Ω = \{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$
has $P(X = x_j) = 1/n$ for $j = 1,\ldots,n$.

### Normal

The _standard normal_ random variable, $Z$, has density function $\phi(x) = \exp(-x^2/2)/\sqrt{2\pi}$.

If $X$ is normal then $E\exp(N) = \exp(E[N] + \mathrm{Var}(N)/2)$ so the cumulants satisfy
$κ_n = 0$ for $n > 2$.

This follows from 
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[e^N] &= E[e^{\mu + \sigma Z}] \\
       &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{\mu + \sigma z} e^{-z^2/2}\,dz/\sqrt{2\pi}\\
	   &= e^{\mu + \sigma^2/2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-(z - \sigma)^2/2}\,dz/\sqrt{2\pi}\\
	   &= e^{\mu + \sigma^2/2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-z^2/2}\,dz/\sqrt{2\pi}\\
	   &= e^{\mu + \sigma^2/2}
\end{aligned}
$$

For any normal random variable, $N$, $E[e^N f(N)] = E[e^N] E[f(N + \mathrm{Var}(N)]$.

__Exercise__. Prove this by first showing $E[e^{\sigma Z} f(Z)] = e^{\sigma^2/2} E[f(Z + \sigma)]$.

If $N$, $N_1$, \ldots, are jointly normal then
$E[e^N f(N_1,\ldots)] = E[e^N] E[f(N_1 + \Cov(N,N_1),\ldots)]$.

### Poisson

A _Poisson_ random variable with parameter $\lambda$ is defined by
$P(X = k) = e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k/k!$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots$.

If $X$ is Poisson with parameter $\lambda$ then 
$$
\begin{aligned}
Ee^{sX} &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty e^{sk} e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k/k!\\
        &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty  (e^s\lambda)^ke^{-\lambda}/k!\\
		&= \exp(\lambda(e^s - 1))
\end{aligned}
$$
so $κ(s) = \lambda(e^s - 1)$ and $κ_n = \lambda$ for all $n$.

### Infinitely Divisible

A random variable, $X$, is _infinitely divisible_ if for any positive integer, $n$,
there exist independent, identically distributed random variables $X_1$,\ldots,$X_n$
such that $X_1 + \cdots + X_n$ has the same law as $X$.

A theorem of Kolmogorov states for every infinitely divisible random variable the exists
a number $\gamma$ and a non-decreasing function $G$ with

$$
κ(s) = \log E e^{sX} = \gamma s + \int_{-\infty}^\infty K_s(x)\,dG(x),
$$

where $K_s(x) = (e^{sx} - 1 - sx)/x^2 = \sum_{n=2}^\infty x^{n-2}s^n/n!$.
Note if $G(x) = 1_{(-\infty,0]}$ then $κ(s) = \gamma s + K_s(0) = \gamma s + s^2/2$
so the random variable is normal.

Note the cumulants of the random variable are $κ_1 = \gamma$ and
$κ_n = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^{n - 2}\,dG(x)$ for $n \ge 2$.

If $G(x) = a^2 1_{(-\infty,a]}$ for $a\not=0$ then
$$
\begin{aligned}
κ(s) &= \gamma s + a^2 K_s(a)\\ 
          &= \gamma s + a^2 \sum_{n=2}^\infty a^{n-2}s^n/n!\\ 
          &= \gamma s + \sum_{n=2}^\infty a^n s^n/n!\\ 
          &= \gamma s - as + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a^n s^n/n!\\ 
          &= (\gamma - a)s + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a^n s^n/n!\\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

so the random variable is Poisson with parameter $a$ plus the constant $\gamma - a$.

This theorem states every infinitely divisible random variable can be
approximated by a normal plus a linear combination of independent Poisson
random variables.

If $X = \mu + \sigma Z + \sum_j \alpha_j a_j^2 P_j$ where $P_j$ is Poisson
with parameter $a_j$, then
$$
κ(s) = \mu s + \sigma s^2/2 + \sum_j \alpha_j (e^{a_j s} - 1) - \alpha_j s
$$

### Characteristic Function

The _characteristic function_ of a random variable, $X$, is $\xi(t) = κ(it)$.

### Fourier Transform

The _Fourier transform_ is $\psi(t) = \xi(-t) = κ(-it)$.
Clearly $\psi(t) = \xi(-t)$.

These can be used to prove the _central limit theorem_:
if $X_j$ are independent, identically distributed random variables with mean zero
and variance one, then $(X_1 + \cdots X_n)/sqrt{n}$ converges to a standard
normal random variable.

## Partition

A _partition_ of a set $ Ω$ is a collection of subsets (events)
that are _pairwise disjoint_ with union $ Ω$.
A partition $\mathcal{A} = \{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ satisfies $A_i\subseteq Ω$ for all $i\in I$,
$A_i\cap A_j = \emptyset$ if $i \not= j$, and $\cup_{i\in I} A_i =  Ω$.
The elements $A_i$ of the partition $\mathcal{A}$ are called _atoms_.

__Exercise__. _If $\{A_i\}$ are pairwise disjoint show $A_i\cap A_j\cap
A_k = \emptyset$ if $i$, $j$, and $k$ are distinct._

__Exercise__. _If $\{A_i\}$ are pairwise disjoint show $A_i\cap A_j\cap
A_k = \emptyset$ if $i$, $j$, and $k$ are not all the same._

__Exercise__. _If $\{A_i\}$ are pairwise disjoint show $\cap_{j\in J}A_j =
\emptyset$ if $J\subseteq I$ has at least two elements._

Partitions represent partial information. 
Complete information means knowing what outcome $ω\in Ω$ occured.
This corresponds to the _finest_ partition consisting of singletons
$\{\{ω\}:ω\in Ω\}$.  Complete lack of information
corresponds to the _coarsest_ partion consisting of one set $\{ Ω\}$.
Partial information correponds to knowing what atom of a partition $ω$ belongs to.

Partitions have a _partial ordering_ where $\mathcal{A}\preceq\mathcal{B}$ indicates
every atom of $\mathcal{A}$ is a union of atoms in $\mathcal{B}$. In this case we say
$\mathcal{B}$ is a _refinement_ of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is _finer_ than $\mathcal{A}$
or $\mathcal{A}$ is _coarser_ than $\mathcal{B}$.

Recall a partial ordering is _reflexive_: $\mathcal{A}\preceq\mathcal{A}$ and
_transitive_:$\mathcal{A}\preceq\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}\preceq\mathcal{C}$
imply $\mathcal{A}\preceq\mathcal{C}$ for $A,B,C\subseteq Ω$.

__Exercise__. _Show refinement is a partial ordering._

### Algebra of Sets

More advanced texts use an _algebra_ of sets instead of a partition.
An algebra of sets is a collection of subsets closed under complement and union
that also contains the empty set.

Since algebras are closed under complement $ Ω = \emptyset' =
 Ω\setminus\emptyset$
is also in the algebra.

By [De Morgan's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws)
an algebra is also closed under intersection since
$A\cap B = (A'\cup B')'$.

If $E$ and $F$ are elements of an algebra we can use plain English to
talk about 'not $E$' ($E'=  Ω\setminus E$), '$E$ or $F$' ($E\cup F$), and
'$E$ and $F$' ($E\cap F$). The phrases '$E$ implies $F$' and 'if $E$ then $F$'
correspond to $E\subseteq F$.

An _atom_ of an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is an element $A\in\mathcal{A}$ with
the property $B\subseteq A$ and $B\in\mathcal{A}$ imply $B = \emptyset$
or $B = A$.

__Exercise__. _If an algebra is finite its atoms form a partition._

_Hint_: Show $A_ω = \cap\{B\in\mathcal{A}:ω\in B\}$ is an atom for all $ω\in Ω$. 

If $\mathcal{A}$ is infinite then there is no guarantee the intersection above is still
in $\mathcal{A}$. A _countably addititve measure_ guarantees the algebra is closed under
countable unions (and hence countable intersections) and $P(\cup_i E_i) = \sum_i P(E_i)$ if
$(E_i)_{i\in\mathbf{N}}$ are pairwise disjoint. These conditions are required to prove
_limit theorems_ about measures.

For example, The Borel-Cantelli lemma states that if $\sum_i P(E_i) <
\infty$ for any countable collection of events $(E_i)_{i\in\mathbf{N}}$
then none of the events can occur _infinitely often_. The outcome $ω$ occurs
after $k$ if $ω\in\cup_{k > n} E_k$. If an outcome occurs a finite number
of times then $ω\not\in\cup_{k > n} E_k$ for sufficiently large $k$.
If the outcome occurs in an infinite number of events then
$ω\in\cap_n \cup_{k > n} E_k$ and we say $ω$ occurs _infinitely often_.
For any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $n$ such that $\sum_{k > n} P(E_k) < \epsilon$
since the infinite sum converges to a finite value.

A _holding_ is an _amount_, _instrument_, and _owner_: $h = (a, i, o)$.
The owner $o$ holds amount $a$ of intrument $i$. They have the rights
and obligations associated with owning the intsrument.

A _portfolio_ is a set of holdings. Since this is just math we can assume
the portfolio consists of all current holdings in the world even though
we don't know what those are.

An _exchange_ is when a _buyer_ accepts what a _seller_ offers at a given time $t$..
The buyer holding $h = (a,i,o)$ is exchanged for the seller's holding $h' = (a',i',o')$
resulting in a new portfolio after the exchange has settled.
The portfolio at time $t$ $\{\ldots,(a,i,0),\ldots(a',i',o'),\ldots\}$
becomes $\{\ldots,(a',i',0),\ldots(a,i,o'),\ldots\}$ after settlement.

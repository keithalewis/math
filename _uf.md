title: Derivative Valuation
___

Consider a contract $C$ where the buyer would like to receive the price of stock $S$ at time $T$.
The contract seller asks for some amount at time 0 and is obligated to 
satisfy the contract. This is the simplest case of derivative valuation.
The seller can just buy one share of $S$ for $S_0$ at time $0$,
then sell it at time $T$ to fulfill the contract.

A _derivative_ is a (legal) contract: I will give you this at these times
if you will give me that at those times. A _buyer_ specifies what
cash flows they would like to receive and a _seller_ specifies
what cash flows they require in order to enter the contract.
Unlike a bond or a stock, there are no physical assets behind a
derivative contract. When a company goes bankrupt you can recover
some fraction of their remaining assets if you hold a bond or stock.
When one counterparty abrogates their obligation in a derivative contract,
the other only holds a piece of paper.

If the seller asks for the price of the stock at time 0,
invest that in one share of the stock, and sells it at time $T$.

$\alpha = (a, i , e)$

$\chi = (\alpha, \alpha')$

## What Quants Do

- Model future prices and cash flows.
- Parameterize models to fit market data.
- Compute expected values and derivatives.
- Specify hedges.
- Measure how good the hedge is.

::: notes
Not a talk about abstract math.
Nothing new. Things every practitioners knows.
Tie together things you already know in a bow.
At end of talk...

## What Quants Don't

- Provide realistic models.
- Specify _when_ to hedge.
- Use parameters traders understand.
- Manage risk.

::: notes
Continuous time is baloney. Heston model?

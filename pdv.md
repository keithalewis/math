When a trader sets up an initial hedge for an option they usually come
up with a volatility to plug into the Black-Scholes/Merton formula for
delta.  As time goes by, they rehedge using the formula for gamma. If
stock prices were geometric Brownian motion generated by a computer then
the same volatility could be used over the life of the option.
Of course they are not, so traders might observe underlying stock prices
$S_j$ at times $t_j$ update their volatility guess based on that.
In this case the volatility is _path dependent_.

The B-S/M model assumes stock prices satisfy $dS_t/S_t = \mu\,dt + \sigma\,dB_t$
where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are constant and $(B_t)_{t\ge0}$ is standard Bronwnian motion.
The Ito calculus shows $(dS_t/S_t)^2 = \sigma^2\,dt$ so a natural extension
to path dependent volatility might be $dS_t/S_t = \mu\,dt + \Sigma_t\,dB_t$ with
${\Sigma_t^2 = (1/t)\int_0^t (dS/S)^2}$. The volatility $\Sigma$ is the average
of the realized volatility. Unfortunately, this is not a good model since
it implies $\Sigma$ is constant.
Since $t\Sigma_t^2 = \int_0^t (dS/S)^2 = \int_0^t \Sigma_s^2\,ds$
we have $d(t\Sigma_t^2) = \Sigma_t^2$. By the Ito calculus we
also have $d(t\Sigma_t^2) = t\,d\Sigma^2_t + \Sigma_t^2\,dt$ so
$0 = t\,d\Sigma_t^2$ and $\Sigma_t$ must be constant.

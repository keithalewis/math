Everything in classical mathematics is expressed in terms of first-order predicate logic.
It extends propositional logic by adding quantification over propositions
parameterized by variables.

## Predicate

Mathematicians use a vocabulary even more impoverished than that of a sailor.
Proposition logic uses only the words _not_, _and_, _or_, and _implies_.
The mathematical symbols for these words are $\neg$, $\and$, $\or$,
and $\implies$.
A _proposition_ is a statement that is either true or false.  You already
know the meaning of the first three words. The mathematical definition
of $P$ implies $Q$ is not $P$ or $Q$, ${P\implies Q \equiv (\neg P)\and Q}$.
The symbol $\equiv$ indicates a tautology. For any values of
$P$ and $Q$ both sides are either both true or both false.

__Exercise__. _Show $P$ implies $Q$ is true if $P$ is false_.

You are not the only one to think this is a bit odd.  Mathematicians
must use common words to define things. The choice of the word _implies_ should not be
construed to mean $P$ _causes_ $Q$.

All of these word can be defined in terms of _nand_, the negation of _and_,
$P\nand Q \equiv \neg(P\and Q)$.

__Exercise__, _Show $\neg P \equiv P\nand P$_.

_Hint_: If $P$ is true then $P$ and $P$ is true.
If $P$ is false then $P$ and $P$ is false.

__Exercise__. _Show $P\and Q \equiv \neg(P\nand Q)$_.

_Hint_: That is the definition of nand.

__Exercise__. _Show $P\or Q \equiv \neg(\neg P \and \neg Q)$._.

### Well-Formed

Here is the recipe for all _sell-formed formulas_.

1. A proposition is a WFF.

2. If $\phi$ is a WFF then $\neg \phi$ is a WFF.

3. If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are WFFs then $\phi\nand \psi$ is a WFF.

We use lower-case Greek letters for WFFs built from these rules.

We use parentheses to indicate the order in which the rules were applied.
For example, $\neg P \nand Q$ could be either
$(\neg P)\nand Q$ (apply rule 2 to $P$ and rule 3 to that and $Q$)
or $\neg(P\nand Q)$ (apply rule 3 to $P$ and $Q$ then rule 2 to that).

<details><summary>Polish Notation</summary>
We can avoid parenthesis by assuming negation applies to the next valid WWF
and nand applies to the next two WWFs.
For example $\nand\neg P Q$ is $(\neg P)\nand Q$
and $\neg\nand P Q$ is $\neg(P\nand Q)$.

## First Order

In _first order logic_ propositions can be parameterized variables.

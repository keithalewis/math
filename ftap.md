"The Structure of the Cost of Capital under Uncertainty"

>  The present study represents an attempt at a slightly different approach. We postulate
 the existence of equilibrium prices for capital assets under uncertainty, and then proceed to
 analyze the properties implicit in their definition. It is shown that some results can be
 derived without recourse to the way individuals make decisions, their detailed preferences
 or their subjective assessments of probabilities

Section II. $T$ finite times. $S$ state space, $(e_t^i)_i$ partition of $S$ at $t\in T$.
$Z = \RR^{\cup_{t,i} e_t^i}$ is prospect space.

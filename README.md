# README

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is used to create html and pdf files from Markdown
using KaTex and LaTeX.

The Makefile has targets for `make file.html` and `make file.pdf` to generate from `file.md`

Use `make docs` to create html docs for GitHub pages that can be found [here](https://keithalewis.github.io/math/).

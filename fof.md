_Issuers_ create _instruments_. A company can issue stocks or bonds to raise capital,
exchanges create contracts to connect liquidity providers with their customers.
Commodities originate from producers of the physical product and
currencies are issued by governments of countries.

Some instruments have _cash flows_. 
Stocks may have dividends, bonds may have coupons, futures have periodic margin adjustments. 
Commodities and currencies do not have cash flows.
The _issuer_ of an instrument determines when and what amount to give
per unit of amount to instrument holders.

A _holding_ is an _amount_ of an _instrument_ held by a _legal entity_. 
Amounts have units based on the instrument: stocks have _shares_,
bonds have _notional_, futures have _contract size_,
commodities have physical quantities, currencies have denominations.

Holdings are _transacted_ over time.
_Sellers_ determine what holdings they are willing to exchange with _buyers_. 
Buyers decide when to transact an available exchange of holdings with a seller.
A transaction involves a _trade date_, _settlement date_, and an exchange
of holdings between a _buyer_ and a _seller_. 
The _price_ of the transaction is the quotient of the buyer amount and the seller amount.
Ownership of holdings is transferred on the settlement date.
The _position_ of an entity is their set of holdings at any given time.

The sum of the amounts of each instrument in a position is the _net_ position in that instrument.
Given prices of instruments in some currency, the net positions can be
converted to the _value_, _mark-to-market_, of the position in that currency.
Accountants call this the _balance sheet_.
The difference of the net value of positions at the beginning and end of
a period is the _profit and loss_ over the period.

Profit and loss does not capture the dynamics over the period.
Cash flows and transactions cause changes to positions.
Instrument holders receive cash flows based on the amount held, 
transactions involve an exchange of holdings between the buyer and seller.
These show up the trade blotter _account_.
Accountants call this the _cash flow statement_.

Ignoring taxes, lawyers, and events of God, this is a complete vocabulary
for discussing everything involved with accounting for financial activity.

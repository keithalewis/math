# Foundations of Finance

A _holding_ is an _amount_ of an _instrument_ held by a _legal entity_. 
Amounts have units based on the instrument. Stocks have _shares_,
bonds have _notional_, futures have _contract size_,
commodities have physical units, currencies have denominations.

All instruments have _issuers_. 
Stocks and bonds are issued by companies to raise capital. 
Futures are created by _exchanges_ to match _liquidity providers_ with consumers.
Commodities originate from producers of the physical product. 
Currencies are issued by governments of countries.

Some instruments have cash flows. 
Stocks may have dividends, bonds may have coupons, futures have periodic margin adjustments. 
Commodities and currencies do not have cash flows.
The _issuer_ of an instrument determines when and what amount to give
per unit of amount to instrument holders.

Holdings are _transacted_ over time.
_Sellers_ determine what holdings they are willing to exchange with _buyers_. 
Buyers decide when to transact an available exchange of holdings with a seller.
A transaction involves a _trade date_, _settlement date_, and an exchange
of holdings between a _buyer_ and a _seller_. 
The _price_ of the transaction is the quotient of the buyer amount and the seller amount.
Ownership of holdings is transferred on the settlement date.

Transactions lead to some bean counting. The _position_ of an entity is their set of holdings.
The changes over time determing the profit and loss.

This note provides a simple and rigorous mathematical model for valuing, hedging,
and managing the risk of **all** derivative instruments. It is based on [@Ros1978]
"A Simple Approach to the Valuation of Risky Streams" where he showed

> _If there are no arbitrage opportunities in the capital markets, then
there exists a (not generally unique) valuation operator, $L$_.

The not generally unique valuation operators are determined by _deflators_:
positive measures that depend only on the information available at
each trading time. Ross's theory applies to all instruments, not just a
bond, stock, and option that [@BlaSch1973] and [@Mer1973] considered.
His insight was to realize option valuation has
nothing to do with probability and used the Hahn-Banach theorem to show
prices are constrained by the geometry determined by cash flows.

There is a clear trajectory in Mathematical Finance from simple 
closed-form models to those allowing more realistic features to be incorporated.
Classical models assume there is no bid-ask spread (perfect liquidity)
and prices are a real numbers (infinitely divisible). We also make that
unrealistic assumption.

The Achilles Heel of the Black-Scholes/Merton model is that it assumes
continuous-time trading. This leads to infeasible trading strategies
and obviously incorrect valuations.  The doubling strategy pointed
out by [@HarKre1979] is impossible to carry out.
According to the B-S/M theory the value of a barrier option
that knocks in the $n$-th time the barrier is hit is the same for all $n>0$.
If Brownian motion hits $a$ at time $\tau$ then it hits $a$ infinitely
often in the interval $[\tau, \tau + \epsilon]$ for any $\epsilon > 0$.
See [@KarShr1991] Section 3.2.

A derivative instrument is a contract. The seller is obligated to
to satisfy cash flows specified in the contract the buyer agrees to.
The fundamental problem every sell side trader faces the first day on the job is
when and how many market instruments to buy in order to manage risk.

This note provides a simple universal model that provides
a foundation for making advances on this important and poorly understood problem.

## Model

Let $\Omega$ be a sample space representing everything that can happen.
Information at time $t$ is modeled by a partition $\AA_t$ of $\Omega$. We assume
$\AA_u$ is a refinement of $\AA_t$ whenever $u > t$.
The possible _trading times_ $T$ are a subset of the non-negative real numbers.
To avoid doubling strategies
we assume $T\cap[0,t]$ is finite for all $t$ so $T$ has no accumulation points.
Finally, let $I$ be the set of all market instruments.

We use $B(\Omega)$ to denote the space of bounded functions on $\Omega$.
Recall its vector space dual can be identified with the space of
finitely additive measures on $\Omega$ denoted $ba(\Omega)$.
For any $f\in B(\Omega)$ define the linear operator of multiplication by $f$,
$M_f\colon B(\Omega)\to B(\Omega)$, by $M_fg = fg$.
Its adjoint is the linear operator $M_f^*\colon ba(\Omega)\to ba(\Omega)$. 
This defines multiplying a measure by a function $f\phi = M_f^*\phi$
for $f\in B(\Omega)$ and $\phi\in ba(\Omega)$.
We call $f$ the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $f\phi$ with respect to $\phi$.

## Market

Instruments have prices and cash flows indexed by $T$.
The _price_ at time $t\in T$ is a bounded $\RR^I$-valued function
$X_t\in B(\Omega,\RR^I)$.
The _cash flows_ that result from holding an instrument are
also bounded $\RR^I$-valued functions $C_t\in B(\Omega,\RR^I)$.
Examples of cash flows are stock dividends, bond coupons, and margin adjustments from futures.
The price of a futures contract is always zero.
Usually $C_t = 0$ for all but a finite number of times $t\in T$.

## Trading

A _trading strategy_ is a finite number of strictly increasing stopping times
$\tau_j\colon\Omega\to T$, $0\le j\le n$,
and number of shares to buy at $\tau_j$ denoted $\Gamma_j\colon\Omega\to\RR^I$ where
$\Gamma_j$ is constant on $\{\tau_j = t\}$ for all $t\in T$.
Shares accumulate to position $\Delta_t = \sum_{\tau_j < t} \Gamma_j$. Note the
strict inequality. Trades take some time to settle before becoming part of the position.
We also write this as $\Delta_t = \sum_{s < t} \Gamma_s$ where $\Gamma_s = \Gamma_j$ when $s = \tau_j$
and is zero otherwise. Note $\Delta_t + \Gamma_t = \Delta_u$ for $u > t$ when $u - t$ sufficiently small.

## Accounting

The _value_, or _mark-to-market_, of a position is how much would be made if
the position was liquidated at current prices, ${V_t = (\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t}$.
Trade $\Gamma_t$ is not part of the position at time $t$ but will be at $t + \epsilon$ and needs to be accounted for.
The _amount_ associated with a trading strategy at time $t$
is ${A_t = \Delta_t\cdot C_t - \Gamma_t\cdot X_t}$: cash flows proportional
to position are credited and trades just executed are debited at the current market price.

## Arbitrage

We define arbitrage (for this model) as the existence of a trading strategy 
with $A_{\tau_0} > 0$ and $A_t\ge0$, for $t > \tau_0$: the first trade makes money and
subsequent trades never lose money.
We also require the strategy to eventually closes out, $\sum_j \Gamma_j = 0$,
otherwise borrowing a dollar every day would be an arbitrage.[^1]
Note our definition of arbitrage does not involve a probability measure.

[^1]: Nick Leeson used this strategy to put 233 year old, at the time, Barings Bank out of business.

__Theorem__. (Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing) _The Simple Universal Model is
arbitrage free if and only if there exist a_ deflator _, positive measures $D_t$ in $ba(\AA_t)$, $t\in T$, with_
$$
\tag{1}	X_t D_t = (X_u D_u + \sum_{t < s \le u} C_s D_s)|_{\AA_t}, t\le u
$$
_where $|$ indicates restriction of measure_.

The proof relies on the following two lemmas.

__Lemma__. _Using the above definitions_
$$
\tag{2}	V_t D_t = (V_u D_u + \sum_{t < s \le u} A_s D_s)|_{\AA_t}, t\le u.
$$

This is the skeleton key to valuing, hedging, and managing the risk
of _any_ derivative instrument.

**Trading strategies create synthetic instruments where price, $X$, corresponds
to value, $V$, and cash flow, $C$, corresponds to amount, $A$.**

_Proof_: If at most one cash flow occurs in the interval $(t,u]$
then ${X_t D_t = (X_u D_u + C_u D_u)|_{\AA_t}}$ and
${\Delta_t + \Gamma_t = \Delta_u}$ is $\AA_t$ measurable.
Using $\Delta_u\cdot C_u = \Gamma_u\cdot X_u + A_u$ we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
V_t D_t &= (\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t D_t \\
	&= \Delta_u\cdot (X_u D_u + C_u D_u)|_{\AA_t} \\
	&= (\Delta_u\cdot X_u D_u + \Delta_u C_u D_u)|_{\AA_t} \\
	&= (\Delta_u\cdot X_u + (\Gamma_u\cdot X_u + A_u)D_u|_{\AA_t} \\
	&= (\Delta_u + \Gamma_u)\cdot X_u + A_u)D_u|_{\AA_t} \\
	&= (V_u + A_u)D_u|_{\AA_t} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
The lemma is established by finite induction since $T$ has no accumulation points.

We say $(M_t)_{t\in T}$ is a martingale measure if $M_t\in ba(\AA_t)$
and $M_t = M_u|_{\AA_t}$ for $u > t$.

__Lemma__. _If $(M_t)_{t\in T}$ is an $\RR^I$-valued martingale
measure and $D_t\in ba(\AA_t)$ are positive then_
$$
	X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s\le t} C_s D_s
$$
_is an arbitrage-free model of prices and cash flows_.

This follows from substituting $X_u D_u = M_u - \sum_{s\le u} C_s D_s$
in equation (1)
to obtain the arbitrage-free condition:
$$
\begin{aligned}
	(X_u D_u + \sum_{t < s \le u} C_s D_s)|_{\AA_t} 
		&= (M_u - \sum_{s\le u} C_s D_s + \sum_{t < s \le u} C_s D_s)|_{\AA_t} \\
		&= (M_u - \sum_{s\le t} C_s D_s)|_{\AA_t} \\
		&= M_t - \sum_{s\le t} C_s D_s \\
		&= X_t D_t \\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

_Proof_ (FTAP): Since ${V_{\tau_0} = (\sum_{u > \tau_0} A_u D_u)|_{\AA_t}}$ and
if $A_t \ge 0$ for $t > \tau_0$ then $V_{\tau_0} \ge 0$.
Since $\Delta_{\tau_0} = 0$ we have ${V_{\tau_0} = \Gamma_{\tau_0}\cdot X_{\tau_0}}$
and ${A_{\tau_0} = -\Gamma_{\tau_0}\cdot X_{\tau_0}}$ so ${A_{\tau_0} = -V_{\tau_0} \le 0}$.
This shows the model is arbitrage-free and proves the "easy" direction of the FTAP.

The proof of the contrapositive involves the Hahn-Banach theorem, but
there is no need for that. Every arbitrage-free model used in practice has the above parameterization.

## Derivative

A (cash settled) derivative contract is specified by stopping times ${\hat{\tau}_j}$ and cash
flows $\hat{A}_j$.  If there exists a trading strategy
$(\tau_j,\Gamma_j)$ with ${\sum_j \Gamma_j = 0}$, ${A_{\hat{\tau}_j} = \hat{A}_j}$
and ${A_t = 0}$ (self-financing) otherwise, then a perfect hedge exists.
The value of the derivative instrument is determined by
$$
\tag{3}	V_t D_t = (\sum_{\hat{\tau}_j > t} \hat{A}_j D_{\hat{\tau}_j})|_{\AA_t}.
$$
Note the right hand side is determined by the contract specifications and deflator.
Assuming $\tau_0 = 0$, $V_0 = \Gamma_0\cdot X_0$ so the initial hedge $\Gamma_0$ is the Fr√©chet 
derivative $D_{X_0}V_0$ with respect to $X_0$.
Since $V_t = (\Gamma_t + \Delta_t)\cdot X_t$ we have
$\Gamma_t = D_{X_t}V_t - \Delta_t$. Note $\Delta_t$ is settled prior to time $t$.

If we choose a strategy trading at every $T = \epsilon\NN$
then as $\epsilon$ goes to zero this can be recognized as a generalization of the
classical B-S/M model where $\Delta$ is delta and $\Gamma$ is gamma.
<!-- ??? what is variance of hedge given epsilon -->

A feature of the SUM is there is no canonical choice for the trading times $(\tau_j)$. 
The B-S/M model obscures the essential problem faced by every trader: when and
how how much of each instrument are required to hedge. It is simply not possible
to hedge continuously.
The SUM forces you to consider this fundamental question.

Semi-Static hedging involves finding an initial static hedge that approximately
replicates the option, then finding a dynamic hedge to improve on the difference.
See [@CarEllGup1998] for early work and [@SauTou2024] for recent improvements
of this technique.

## Examples

### Canonical Deflator

If repurchase agreements are available they determine a _canonical deflator_.
A repurchase agreement over the interval $[t_j, t_{j+1}]$ is specified
by a rate $f_j$ known at time $t_j$. The price at $t_j$ is $1$ and it
has a cash flow of ${\exp(f_j\Delta t_j)\approx 1 + f_j\Delta t_j}$ at time $t_{j+1}$
where $\Delta t_j = t_{j+1} - t_j$.

By equation (1) we have ${D_j = \exp(f_j\Delta t_j)D_{j+1}|_{\AA_j}}$.
If $D_{j+1}$ is known at time $t_j$ then ${D_{j+1} = \exp(-f_j\Delta t_j)D_j}$ and
${D_n = \exp(-\sum_{j < n} f_j\Delta t_j) D_{t_0}}$ is the canonical deflator
at time $t_n$.

The continuous time analog is $D_t = \exp(-\int_0^t f_s\,ds)D_0$ where
$f$ is the continuously compounded instantaneous forward rate.
This is commonly referred to as the _stochastic discount_
and the reciprocal $R_t = 1/D_t$ is called the _money market account_.
It is convenient to assume there is an instrument with price $R_t$
and no cash flows exists in order to finance trading strategies.

It is rare for market participants to use repos to finance their trading.
Traders working for large banks have access to a funding desk that
charges them the repo rate plus a few basis points. Day traders
using a credit card to fund trading get charged at the APR they qualifiy for.

The SUM model does not assume a risk-free rate exists. If a funding
instrument is being used then it, or all the instruments used to mimic it,
should be added to the set of instruments $I$.


<!--
but every big bank has a repo desk of traders working
diligently every day to provide this simplifying illusion.

The Secured Overnight Financing Rate
([SOFR](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/sofr))
is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.

Investors hedging derivatives must use their available funding rate.
-->

### Zero Coupon Bond

A _zero coupon bond_ maturing at time $u$ has a single unit cash flow at $u$,
$C_u^{D(u)} = 1$ and $C_t^{D(u)} = 0$ for $t\not=u$.
In an arbitrage free model its price at time $t\le u$, $X_t^{D(u)} = D_t(u)$,
satisfies $D_t(u) D_t = D_u|_{\AA_t}$ so
$D_t(u)$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $D_u|_{\AA_t}$ with respect to $D_t$.

Note $D_0(u)D_0 =  D_u|_{\AA_0}$ so the discount to time $u$ is $D_0(u) = D_u(\Omega)/D_0(\Omega)
=  D_u(\Omega)$ assuming, without loss of generality, that $D_0(\Omega) = 1$.
This technically makes $D_0$ a "probability measure," but it is not the probability of anything. 

Zero coupon bond prices are determined by the deflators.
The [@BraGatMus1997] model corresponds to using the canonical deflator
built from futures instead of repos.
The [@HeaJarMor1992] model corresponds to using
the continuous time forward rates.


### Fixed Income

_Fixed income_ instruments pay fixed cash flows $c_j$ at times $t_j$.
From equation (2), the value of a fixed income instrument at time $t$ is determined by
$$
	V_t D_t  = (\sum_{t_j > t} c_j D_{t_j})|_{\AA_t}
$$
so $V_t = \sum_{t_j > t} c_j D_t(t_j)$.

### Risky Bonds

Bonds can default and the holder recovers only a fraction of the remaining value.
Let $\tau$ be the time the bond defaults and $\rho$ be the fraction of the value recovered.
These are both random variables.
The original sample space must be augmented by the cartesion product with $[0,\infty)\times [0,1]$
indicating the default time and recovery. At time $t$ the information we have
about the default time is either $\tau < t$ and we know exactly when default happened,
otherwise we only know $\tau\ge t$. This corresponds to the
partition of $[0,\infty)$ consisting of singletons $\{s\}$, $s < t$, and
the atom $[t,\infty)$. We assume if default occurs at time $t$ then we
learn about it later.

A risky zero coupon bond maturing at $u$ pays in full at $u$ if $\tau > u$
and $\rho D_\tau(u)$ at $\tau$ if $t\le\tau\le u$. By equation (2) its value
$V_t = D_t^{\tau,\rho}(u)$ satisfies
$$
	D_t^{\tau,\rho}(u) D_t = (\rho D_\tau(u)1(t\le\tau\le u) D_\tau + 1(\tau >u)D_u)|_{\AA_t}.
$$
Since $D_\tau(u)D_\tau|_{\AA_t} = D_u|_{\AA_t}$ for $t\le\tau\le u$ this simplifies to
$$
	D_t^{\tau,\rho}(u) D_t = ((\rho 1(t\le\tau\le u) + 1(\tau >u))D_u)|_{\AA_t}.
$$
If we make the usual unrealistic assumptions that $\tau$ is independent of 
all $(D_t)_{t\in T}$ and $\rho$ is constant then
$$
	D_t^{\tau,\rho}(u) D_t = (\rho P(t\le\tau\le u) + P(\tau > u))D_t(u).
$$
If $\rho = 1$ or $\tau = \infty$ we have
$ D_t^{\tau,\rho}(u) D_t(\{\omega\}\times [t,\infty)) = P(\tau > t)D_t(u)(\{\omega\}\times [t,\infty))$
so $D_t^{\tau,\rho}(u) = D_t(u)$ is the same as a riskless zero coupon bond.

The _credit spread_ $s^{\tau,\rho}(u)$ is defined by
$D_t^{\tau,\rho}(u) = exp(-s^{\tau,\rho}(u)) D_t(u)$ so
$$
	s^{\tau,\rho}(u) = -log (\rho P(t\le\tau\le u) + P(\tau > u))
$$
If $\tau$ is exponentially distributed with hazard rate $\lambda$
then for small $\lambda$ we have the approximation
$$
	s^{\tau,\rho}(u) \approx \lambda (u - \rho(u - t))
$$

### Black-Scholes/Merton

!!!revisit

The Black-Scholes and Merton models have
trading times $T = [0,\infty)$, 
sample space $\Omega = C[0,\infty)$, the set of continuous functions on the non-negative
real numbers, and deflator $D_t = e^{-\rho t}P$ where $P$ is Wiener measure.
The martingale measure
is $M_t = (r, se^{\sigma B_t - \sigma^2t/2})P$ where $(B_t)$ is
standard Brownian motion.

We can generalize this to any L√©vy process $(X_t)$ with $X_1$ having mean
zero and variance one. In this case
$M_t = (r, se^{\sigma X_t - t\kappa(\sigma)})P$ where $\kappa(\sigma)
= \log E[\exp(\sigma X_1)]$ is the _cumulant_ of $X_1$.
Independence and stationarity imply the cumulant of $X_t$ is $t\kappa(\sigma)$
and the distribution of $X_1$ determines the L√©vy process.
See [@Sat1999] for basic facts about L√©vy processes.

Since $X_1$ is infinitely divisible ???cite and has finite variance its cumulant can be
characterized by $\gamma\in\RR$ and a non-decreasing function $\Gamma\colon\RR\to\RR$
with $\lim_{x\to -\infty}\Gamma(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x\to\infty}\Gamma(x) = 1$ where
$$
	\kappa(s) = \log E[e^{sX_1}] = \gamma s + \int_{-\infty}^\infty K_s(x)\,dG(x)
$$
and $K_s(x) = (e^{sx} - 1 - sx)/x^2 = \sum_{k=2}^\infty s^n x^{n-2}/n!$
is the Kolomogorov[@Kol1931] kernel. Note $G(x) = 1_[0,\infty)$ gives
the normal distribution with mean $\gamma$ and variance one. 
If $G(x) = 1_[a,\infty)$, $a\not=0$, we have
$\kappa(s) = \gamma s + (e^{as} - 1 - as)/a^2 = (\gamma - 1/a)s + (1/a^2)(e^{as} - 1)$.
Recall the cumulant of a Posson distribution with parameter $\lambda$
is $\lambda(e^s - 1)$ and the cumulant of $b + cX$ is $bs + \kappa(cs)$ where
$\kappa$ is the cumulant of $X$. This implies $\lambda = 1/a^2$, $a = c$,
and $\gamma - 1/a = b$ so every infinitely divisible distribution can be
approximated by a normal plus a sum of independent Poisson distributions.

### General European Option

A _European option_ on underlying $S$ pays $\nu(S_t)$ for some function $\nu$ at _expiration_ $t$.
For a _put_ $\nu(x) = \max\{k - x, 0\}$ and for a _call_ $\nu(x) = \max\{x - k, 0\}$
where $k$ is the _strike_. If we have a money-market instrument $R$ with price $R_t = 1/D_t$
and a self-financing strategy exists then
the cost of setting that up at time 0 is determined by ${V_0 D_0 = (\nu(S_t) D_t)|_{\AA_0}}$.
Using the "probability" measure $P = D_0$ this can be written
$V_0 = E[\nu(S_t)D_t]$.

The [@Bla1976] model sidesteps interest rates by
computing the forward value of the option $E[\nu(S_t)]$.
A _forward contract_ with strike $k$ pays $S_t - k$ at expiration $t$.
The _forward_ of $S$ at time $t$ is the strike making
the current value of the contract zero.
In this case ${0 = E[(S_t - f)D_t] = E[S_t D_t] - fE[D_t]}$
so ${f = E[S_t D_t]/E[D_t] = S_0/D_0}$. This formula is called the
_cost-of-carry_. ??? revisit

$F_t = fe^{\sigma B_t - \sigma^2t/2}$, where $f = se^{\rho t}$.
The forward value is $E[\nu(F_t)]$.
If a European option pays $\nu(F)$ shares then
$E[F\nu(F)] = fE[e^{sX - \kappa(s)}\nu(F)] = fE^s[\nu(F)]$
where $E^s$ is _share measure_. The Radon-Nikodym derivative
of the correponding "probability" measures is $dP^s/dP = e^{sX - \kappa(s)}$.
Note $e^{sX - \kappa(s)} > 0$ and $E[e^{sX - \kappa(s)}] = 1$ so
$P_s$ is a "probability" measure.

The general Black model is $F = fe^{sX - \kappa(s)}$ where $X$ has mean zero and variance one.
Every positive random variables with finite mean and log variance has this form.
$f = se^{\rho t}$, and $s = \sigma\sqrt{t}$.

The forward put value with strike $k$ is $p(k) = E[\max\{k - F, 0\}] = E[(k - F)1(F\le k)]$ so
$$
\begin{aligned}
	p(k) &= E[\max\{k - F, 0\}] \\
	&= E[(k - F)1(F\le k)] \\
	&= k P(F\le k) - fP^s(F\le k).
\end{aligned}
$$
Put prices determine the distribution of $F$, as [@BreLit1978] showed,
since $\partial_k p(k) = E[1(F\le k)] = P(F\le k)$.

Define _moneyness_ $x = x(f,s,k)$ by $F\le k$ if and only if $X \le x$
so $x = (\log k/f + \kappa(s))/s$ if $s > 0$.

Define the _share cumulative distribution_ by $\Psi(x, s) = P^s(X\le x)$.
Note $\Psi(x, 0)$ is the cumulative distribution of $X$.
The formula for put value is ${p(k) = k \Psi(x, 0) - f \Psi(x, s)}$.

_Delta_ is the derivative of option value with respect to $f$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial_f p &= \partial_f E[\max\{k - F, 0\}] \\
  &= E[-1(F \le k)\partial_f F] \\
  &= E[-1(F \le k)e^{sX - \kappa(s)}] \\
  &= -P^s(F \le k) \\
  &= -\Psi(x, s) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

_Gamma_ is the second derivative of option value with respect to $f$
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \partial_f^2 p &= -\partial_f \Psi(x, s) \\
    &= -\partial_x \Psi(x, s)\partial_f x \\
    &= -\partial_x \Psi(x, s)/\partial_x f \\
    &= \partial_x \Psi(x, s)/f s\\
\end{aligned}
$$

_Vega_ is the derivative of option value with respect to $s$.
The vega of a put option is
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \partial_s p &= \partial_s E[\max\{k - F, 0\}] \\
        &= E[-1(F \le k)\partial_s F] \\
        &= -E[1(X\le x)F(X - \kappa'(s))] \\
        &= -f\partial_s \Psi(x, s) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
The last equality follows from ${\partial_s E^s[1(X\le x)] = E[1(X \le x)e^{sX - \kappa(s)}(X - \kappa'(s))]}$.

Note $\partial_s \Psi(x, s) < 0$ so vega is positive.

??? Proof ???

## Notes

The set exponential $B^A$ is the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$.
For any set $I$, $\RR^I$ is a vector space with scalar multiplication
and vector addition defined pointwise:
${(ax)(i) = ax(i)}$ and ${(x + y)(i) = x(i) + y(i)}$, $a\in\RR$, ${x,y\in\RR^I}$.

A _real valued function_ takes an element of a set to a real number.
A _real valued measure_ takes a subset of a set to a real number. Measures
do not count things twice and the measure of nothing is zero.
If $B(S)$ is the normed vector space of bounded functions on $S$
where the norm of $f\in B(S)$ is ${\|f\| = \sup\{|f(s)|\mid s\in S\}}$
then its dual $B(S)^*$ can be identified with the normed vector
space of bounded finitely additive measures on $S$, $ba(S)$.
The _dual pairing_ ${\langle f,\phi\rangle = \int_\Omega f\,d\phi}$
is defined for _simple functions_,
a finite linear sum ${f = \sum_i a_i 1_{A_i}}$, $A_i\subseteq\Omega$,
by $\int_\Omega f\,d\phi = \sum_i a_i\phi(A_i)$.
Dunford and Schwartz[@DunSch1958] show this is well-defined and an
isometry so it can be extended to all of $B(\Omega)$.

If $\Phi\colon B(S)\to\RR$ is linear define $\phi(E) = \Phi 1_E$ where
$1_E(s) = 1$ if $s\in E$ and $1_E(s) = 0$ if $s\not\in S$.
Since $1_{E\cup F} = 1_E + 1_F - 1_{E\cap F}$ we have
$\phi(E\cup F) = \phi(E) + \phi(F) - \phi(E\cap F)$.
Measures do not count things twice. Since $1_\emptyset = 0$,
$\phi(1_\emptyset) = 0$.

If $\AA$ is a sigma algebra on $\Omega$ then it is an algebra. If it is finite
then the atoms of $\AA$ form a partition of $\Omega$. An _atom_ $B\in\AA$
satisfyies $A\subseteq B$ and $A\in\AA$ implies $A=\emptyset$ or $A = B$.
In this case
a bounded function $X\colon\Omega\to\RR$ is $\AA$-measurable if and only if
$X$ is constant on atoms of $\AA$. That makes it a bounded function on
the atoms of $\AA$ so it belongs to $B(\AA)$.

Our definition of arbitrage is not sufficient. Recall $A_0 = -\Gamma_0\cdot X_0$.
Even if this is strictly positive traders and risk managers will compare it
to $|\Gamma_0|\cdot|X_0|$ as a measure of how much capital will be tied up
in the trading strategy.

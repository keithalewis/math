# What's my P&L?

Every trader knows about slippage. The price quoted by an exchange is not
necessarly the price at which a trade is executed. A market orders get matched
against limit orders like blocks dropping in tetris. Limit order quantities
get eaten up until the market order is filled. It is also possible other
market orders more limit orders are placed in the meantime.

If you have been on a trading floor for more than a week you have probably
heard a discussion between a trader and a back office person about how
their positions were marked-to-market. Traders care about this very much
because that is used to calculate their profit and loss.

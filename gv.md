Let $(X_t)$ be a stochastic process.
Define $\nu(X,t,I) = (X|_{[0,t]})^{-1}(I)$ for $t > 0$, $I\subseteq\RR$.
Let $\sim$ be the relation $x R y$ if and only if the interval
$[x,y]\subseteq \nu_t(I)$. It is an equivalence relation on its domain
and the cardinality of the quotient space is then number of crossings
of $I$ up to time $t$.

Define $\nu(X,t,a) = \{s\le t\mid X_s\le a\}$.
Let $R_a$ be the relation $x R_a y$ if and only if the interval
$[x,y]\subseteq \nu_t(X,t,a)$. It is an equivalence relation on its domain
and the cardinality of the quotient space is then number of crossings
of $I$ up to time $t$.

Let $E_t$ be the taxable earnings at time $t$.

Suppose an instrument was purchased at time $t_0$ at price $P_{t_0}$.
If it is sold at time $t_1$ for price $P_{t_1}$ the _gain_ is $P_{t_1} - P_{t_0}$.
The tax $\tau(\Delta t)$.


Tax loss harvesting involves selling the instrument at time $t_1$
for price $P_{t_1} < P_{t_0}$ and purchasing another instrument
having price $Q_{t_1}$.

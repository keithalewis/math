Thank Cindy Lawrence, Tim, Helper???

Thank Kevin and Leon for getting me up to speed with the MoMath mission.  
My bad if I fall short on their tutelage. (You will be the judge!)

Kevin gave the inaugural lecture. (Ask him!)

Die twice quote.  

Miss him every day. He was not just a coauthor on papers.  
He was my neighbor and we would go to the latest coffee shops opening in Carroll Gardens and geek out on math.  

Inaugurate the Carr Number? (Erdos Number)

Up in a balloon

"Well, it's completely correct."

Met Peter at MS at a talk he organized. Of course.  
Pointed out to the lecturer that he didn't understand risk-neutral vs real-world measures.  
(you will by the end of tonight)
Peter was too polite to point that out, but I wasn't!  
He button-holed me after the talk and told me I was right.  
Come to his office to talk.  

Left for Banc of America Securities, BofA's equity group.  
Jon Sandleman didn't need quants.  
Risk managment shut him down.  
Head of risk had a PhD in Finance. (Walter)
Wall Street think: Hire top PhD in Finance on the street.  
Secret Finance PhD handshake.  
You do need quants to turn math into software traders and risk managers can use.

Financial Engineering  

D(ell) wanted to do a stock buyback.  
No biggie...  
But was about to make an announcement that would push their stock price down.  
Inside insider information.  
Great way to get CFO put in jail.  
Lockout period before company could buy its own stock.  
Call option with expiration after lockout allows company to buy the stock at the option strike.  
Too expensive. Down-and-in call. Get call if barrier is hit. (Known to Merton in 1973)
Too expensive. DIC with early ending barrier. Get call if barrier is hit early.

The first model we implemented was for Early Ending Barrier Options.  
Peter, literally, wrote the paper on those.  
I turned his math into software and got numbers that did not make sense.  
I'm a mathematician, so I was able to find the mistake and fix it.  
Telling your boss they are wrong can be an early ending career option if you are the one who is wrong.  
So I double checked with a Monte Carlo simulation.  

I was so nervous when I went to Peter's office to tell him.  
Fun and games until then.  
When I pointed at a formula in his paper he immediatly recognized the mistake.
He said, "Can you imagine what would happen if we gave traders the wrong numbers?"  
I said, "Yes. Yes I can..."  

When we were there, our group made so much money for the bank they had to pay Jon Sandleman
more than the CEO of BofA.

...Build up how brutal BofA was...

One day Peter's boss came to my office and said, "If I was in the business of writing papers,
I would hire 10 Peter Carr's. But I'm not in that business and we want to start trading convertible bonds."    

Writing on the wall...  

Peter didn't talk to me for a couple of years after that.

When he started at Bloomberg he asked me to take over his DS class at Columbia.  

Invited me to Bloomberg to do their first variance swap model.  


B-S/M

A derivative is a contract. You pay this at these times, I pay that at those times.

Barter is immediate, derivatives involve the future. That entails more risk.

Moving money through time.

Zero coupon bond. Pay discount at 0 get 1 at T.

Simple derivative: pay X at T. Hedge buy X at 0, sell X at t.

Forward: Pay X(T) - F at T. At-the-money if F = X(0).

Call option: pay X - K at T if X > K and 0 otherwise.

dv/ds = delta

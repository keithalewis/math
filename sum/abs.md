In 1973 Black and Scholes, and independently Merton, showed how to value a stock option
using a dynamic hedge involving a funding account and the underlying stock.
They use Brownian motion to model stock price and Itô's Lemma 
to derive their eponymous partial differential equation that option prices satisfy.
In 1978 Ross published "A Simple Approach to the Valuation of Risky Streams"
demonstrating there was no need for the heavy machinery of Itô processes.
Every arbitrage free model admits a linear valuation
operator that we identify as the reciprocal of the funding account.
He also showed the result is purely geometric. Although positive measures
having mass one make an appearance, they are not the probability of anything.
Ross defined a cash flow as a change in price but this leads to problems.

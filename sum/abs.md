In 1973 Black and Scholes, and independently Merton, showed the value
of an option was its discounted expected payoff. They assumed the
underlying stock price was a function of Brownian motion and used the
heavy artillery of It√¥ processes.  In 1978 Ross showed there was no
need for for this. He made no assumptions about the underlying price
process and proved a much more general result not involving probability
that can be used to value all derivative instruments, not just the option
Black-Scholes and Merton considered.

Ross assumed continuous time trading was possible and made the mistake
of identifying cash flows as a jump in the price. We put cash flows
on equal footing with prices and acknowledge the reality
that continuous time trading leads to untenable results.

Every trading strategy creates a synthetic market instrument.
The value/mark-to-market of the strategy corresponds to price and the
amounts involved in executing the strategy correspond to cash flows.

A derivative instrument is just a synthetic market instrument
specified by a contract.
We show how arbitrage-free models of prices and cash flows can be
used to value, hedge, and manage their risk.

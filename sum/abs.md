In 1973 Black and Scholes, and independently Merton, showed how to value a stock option
by a dynamic hedge using a funding account and the underlying stock.
In 1978 Ross published "A Simple Approach to the Valuation of Risky Streams"
showing there was no need for the heavy machinery of Ito Processes and
Partial Differential Equations. Every arbitrage free model admits a linear valuation
operator that we identify as the reciprocal of the funding account value.

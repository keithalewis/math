    <h1>Simple Universal Model</h1>
	<p>Based on Stephen Ross's 1978 paper "A Simple Approach to the Valuation of Risky Streams"</p>

<blockquote><i>If there are no arbitrage opportunities in the capital markets, then
there exists a (not generally unique) [linear] valuation operator, L</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Ross did say "(not generally unique)" but you have to read the paper to
find out they are [linear]. If you have studied calculus, you know
integration takes a function to a number linearly: the integral of
a function times a constant is the constant times the integral, and
the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals.

Peter brought me back into the academic world in 2008.

Trying to get better at teaching. How do you transmit what you know to someone else?

This is a suit.

Met Peter when we both worked for MS at a talk he organized.  
The speaker did not know the difference between real-world measure and risk-neutral measure.  
Peter was too nice to point that out, but I wasn't.  
After the talk he button holed me said he agreed with me.

Peter was good at math, but the first person to admit he had no formal training.

I was his seeing-eye mathematician.

Last question he asked was what is the derivative of $\|x\|^p$.

Frechet derivative. D_x \|x\|^p = p\|x\|^{p-2}x^*$ where $x^*\colon\RR^n\to\RR$ by $x^*(y) = x\cdot y$.

Early ending barrier option with Dell.

Banc of America Securities. Don't they know how to spell? End of the Glass-Steagall era where
banks were not allowed to transact stocks.

Up in a balloon.

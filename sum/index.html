    <h1>Simple Universal Model</h1>
	<p>Based on Stephen Ross's 1978 paper "A Simple Approach to the Valuation of Risky Streams"</p>

<blockquote><i>If there are no arbitrage opportunities in the capital markets, then
there exists a (not generally unique) [linear] valuation operator, L</i>.
</blockquote>

<!--
<p>
Ross did say "(not generally unique)" but you have to read the paper to
find out they are [linear]. If you have studied calculus, you know
integration takes a function to a number linearly: the integral of
a function times a constant is the constant times the integral, and
the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals.

    <h2>Market</h2>
	<p>Instruments have prices and pay associated cash flows:
	bonds pay coupons, stocks pay dividends, futures have margin adjustments.</p>

	<h2>Trading</h2>
    <canvas id="market" style="border: 1px solid #ccc"></canvas>
	<p>
		Increasing (stopping) times \(\tau_0 < \cdots < \tau_n\) and
		number of shares to trade at \(\tau_j\), \(\Gamma_j\colon\mathcal{A}_{\tau_j}\to ℝ^I\)
	</p>

	<h2>Accounting</h2>
	<p>\(V_t = (\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t\)
		is the value, or mark-to-market, of the portfolio.</p>
	<p>\(A_t = \Delta_t\cdot C_t - \Gamma_t\cdot X_t\)
		is the amount showing up at time \(t\) in the trading account.</p>

	<h2>Arbitrage</h2>
	<p>A (finite) trading strategy \((\tau_j, \Gamma_j\)) with $A_{\tau_0} > 0$,
	\(A_t \ge0\), \(t > \tau_0\), and \(\sum_j \Gamma_j = 0\).
	</p>

	<h2>Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing</h2>
	<p>No arbitrage implies there exist positive measures \(D_t\) on \(\mathcal{A}_t\) with

    \[X_t D_t = \sum_{u > t} C_s D_s \mid {\mathcal{A}_t}\]

	Every model is parameterized by a vector valued martingal measure \(M_t\colon\mathcal{A}_t\to  ℝ^I\)
	(i.e., \(M_t = M_u\mid\mathcal{A}_t\) if \(t \le u\))
	and positive measures \(D_t\colon\mathcal{A}_t\to (0,\infty)\) where

	\[ X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s\le t}C_s D_s.\]

	</p>
	<h3>Black-Scholes/Merton</h3>
	<p>
		The B-S/M model takes \(T = [0,\infty)\), \(I\) is a bond and a stock,
		\(\Omega = C[0,\infty)\) is the set of all continuous functions on the
		non-negative real numbers, and \((\mathcal{A}_t)\) is the standard
		filtration for Brownian motion \((B_t)\) with Weiner measure \(P\).
</p><p>
		The B-S/M model is \(M_t = (r, se^{\sigma B_t - \sigma^2 t/2})P\) and
		\(D_t = e^{-\rho t}P\).
	</p>

	Using the definitions of value and amount we have for any trading strategy
    \[V_t D_t = \sum_{u > t} A_s D_s \mid {\mathcal{A}_t}\]
	<em>Trading creates synthetic market instruments where
	value corresponds to price and amount corresponds to cash flow.</em>

	<h2>Derivative</h2>
	<p>
	A (cash settled) derivative is a contact specifying times \((\hat{\tau}_k)\)
	and amounts \((\hat{A}_k)\) to be paid at that time.
	<em>If</em> a trading strategy \(\tau_j, \Gamma_j\) exists with
	$A_{\hat{\tau_k}} = \hat{A}_k$ and \(A_t = 0\) otherwise (self-financing),
	then the strategy is a perfect hedge.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note \(V_0 D_0 = \sum_{u > 0} \hat{A}_{\hat{\tau}_k} D_{\hat{\tau}_k}\)
	can be computed using the contract terms \((\hat{\tau}_k,\hat{A}_k)\)
	and deflators \(D_t\). We also have \(V_0 = (\Delta_0 + \Gamma_0)\cdot X_0
	= \Gamma_0\cdot X_0\) since the initial position $\Delta_0 = 0$.
	The derivative of \(V_0\) with respect to \(X_0\) is \(D_{X_0} V_0 = \Gamma_0\), so
	this gives the initial hedge.
	</p>
	<p>
	In general $V_t = (\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t$
	so \(D_{X_t}V_t = \Delta_t + \Gamma_t\) and
	\(\Gamma_t = D_{X_t}V_t - \Delta_t\). Since \(\Delta_t\)
	is known at time $t$, this gives a general formula of computing hedges.
	</p>
	<p>
	Black-Scholes and Merton make the untenable assumption is it is possible to
	hedge in continuous time. The Simple Universal Model forces the implementer
	to face the difficult but important question of when do you hedge?

Peter brought me back into the academic world in 2008.

Trying to get better at teaching. How do you transmit what you know to someone else?

This is a suit.

Met Peter when we both worked for MS at a talk he organized.  
The speaker did not know the difference between real-world measure and risk-neutral measure.  
Peter was too nice to point that out, but I wasn't.  
After the talk he button holed me said he agreed with me.

Peter was good at math, but the first person to admit he had no formal training.

I was his seeing-eye mathematician.

Last question he asked was what is the derivative of $\|x\|^p$.

Frechet derivative. D_x \|x\|^p = p\|x\|^{p-2}x^*$ where $x^*\colon\RR^n\to\RR$ by $x^*(y) = x\cdot y$.

Early ending barrier option with Dell.

Banc of America Securities. Don't they know how to spell? End of the Glass-Steagall era where
banks were not allowed to transact stocks.

Up in a balloon.

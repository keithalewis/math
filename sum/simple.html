In base 2 that is a number between 0 and 1.

			<h2 id="math">Random Variable</h2>
            <p>A <em>random variable</em> is a variable, a symbol representing a number that 
                can be used in an equration or inequality, that takes a set 
                to the probablity the random variable variable belongs the set when sampled.

			<h2 id="math">White Noise</h2>
            <p>White noise is a random signal having equal intensity at different frequencies, 
                giving it a constant power spectral density.</p>

			<h2>Partial Information</h2>
			<p>How do we represent "knowing the first digit of \(\omega\)?"</p>
			<p>\(\mathcal{A}_1 = \{[0, 1/2), [1/2, 1]\}\)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Function</h2>
			<p>If \(A\) and \(B\) are sets then the <em>set exponential</em> \(B^A = \{f\colon A\to B\}\)
			is the set of all functions from \(A\) to \(B\).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Measure</h2>
			<p>A <em>measure</em> takes a subset of a set to a number. Measures don't count things twice: the measure of the union
			of two sets is the sum of their measures minus the measure of their intersection. The measure of the empty set is zero.</p>
			<p>The simplest example is counting measure: the number of elements of a set.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Hadwiger's Theorem</h3>
			<p>Mathematicians like countably additive measures so they can swap limits and integrals; 
                finitely additive measures can be useful in other contexts.</p>

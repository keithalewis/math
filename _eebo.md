title: Stock buy backs
---

Companies want to buy back their stocks for various reasons but their
ultimate goal is to buy them back as cheaply as possible. Buy backs signal the company thinks
their stock is undervalued and will make their share price go up.

They also have the ultimate insider information.

It is illegal for them to make an announcement that pushes their stock price down and then buy it.
There is a lockout period befor they can legally do that.

Dell approched Banc of America Securities and asked how they could do that legally.
They have to wait to buy after a lockout period.
The first thing proposed was a call option at the strike they wanted to buy
at with an expiration after the lockout. That would allow them to 
buy back their stock at the strike.

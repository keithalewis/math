>	Market instruments can be bought or sold at a price and ownership
	entails cash flows. Shares of instruments can be traded based on
	available information and accumulate to positions. The mark-to-market
	value and amounts involved with trading correspond to price
	and cash flows respectively. The Unified Model demonstrates the connection
	between dynamic trading and how to value, hedge, and manage the
	risk of any portfolio.

>	Every arbitrage-free model of prices and cash flows is
	parameterized by a vector-valued martingale whose components are
	indexed by market instruments and a positive, adapted process
	called a deflator. If repurchase agreements are available they
	determine a canonical deflator.

A _derivative security_ is a contract between two parties: I will
give you this on these dates if you will give me that on those dates.
Derivatives must have existed since before recorded history.  The Nobel
prize winning breakthrough of Black, Scholes, and Merton was
how to synthesize derivatives by dynamically trading market instruments
based on the borrowing cost used to fund the hedge instead of trying to
estimate the growth rate of the underlying securities.

This paper provides a unified model for valuing, hedging, and
managing the risk of any derivative security. It shows how they can
be synthesized by trading market instruments and turns the spotlight on
what may be the next Nobel prize winning problem: how should you hedge
if you can't do it continuously?

The Unified Model can be used for any portfolio of stocks, bonds,
currencies, commodities, and even other derivatives in the portfolio.

## Market Model

We assume the usual setup, $\langle Ω, P, (\AA_t)_{t\in T}\rangle$,
of a sample space $Ω$, a probability measure $P$, and an
increasing filtration of algebras $(\AA_t)$ over the set of trading
times $T$. If you are not familiar with this see the [Notation](#notation) section below.

Every _instrument_ has a _price_ $X_t$ and a _cash flow_ $C_t$ at any
trading time $t\in T$.  Instruments are assumed to be perfectly liquid:
they can be bought or sold at the given price in any amount. Cash flows
are associated with owning an instrument and are almost always 0; stocks
have dividends, bonds have coupons, currencies have no cash flows,
commodities have storage costs.
European options have exactly one
cash flow at expiration.

A _market model_ specifies _prices_
$X_{t}\colon\AA_{t} \rightarrow \RR^{I}$, and _cash flows_
$C_{t}\colon\AA_{t} \rightarrow \RR^{I}$, where $I$ is the
set of available market instruments.

We use the notation $X\colon\AA\to\RR$ to indicate $X\colon Ω\to\RR$
is $\AA$-measurable. If $\AA$ is finite then it is generated by
its atoms and $X$ _is_ a function from the atoms of $\AA$ to $\RR$.

## Trading

A _trading strategy_ is a finite collection of strictly increasing
stopping times $(τ_j)$, and trades $(Γ_j)$ where
$Γ_j:\AA_{τ_j}\rightarrow \RR^{I}$ indicating the number of shares to trade
in each instrument at time $τ_j$. Trades accumulate to a _position_
$Δ_t = \sum_{τ_j < t}Γ_j = \sum_{s < t}Γ_s$ where $Γ_s = Γ_j$ when $s = τ_j$. 
A trade at time $t$ is not included in the position at time $t$;
it takes some time for trades to settle.

The _value_ (or _mark-to-market_) of a position at time $t$ is
$$
	V_t = \left( Δ_t + Γ_t \right) \cdot X_t.
$$
This is what you would get from liquidating your existing position and
trades just executed at the current market price.

The _amount_ generated by the trading strategy at time $t$ is
$$
	A_t = Δ_t \cdot C_t - Γ_t \cdot X_t.
$$
You receive cash flows proportional to your existing position and pay for the trades 
just executed.

## Arbitrage

Arbitrage exists if there is a trading strategy with $A_{τ_0} > 0$, $A_t \ge 0$ for
$t > τ_0$, and $\sum_j Γ_j = 0$; you make money on the first trade and
never lose until the position is closed out.

The _Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing_ (FTAP) states there is no arbitrage
if and only if there exists a _deflator_,
$D_t:\AA_t \rightarrow \left(0,\infty \right)$, with
$$
	X_t D_t = E_t\bigl[X_v D_v + \sum_{t < u \le v} C_u D_u\bigr].
$$
We can assume $D_0 = 1$ since if $D_t$ is a deflator then so is $D_t/D_0$.

Note that if there are no cash flows, $C_t = 0$ for all $t \in T$,
then $X_t D_t$ is a martingale. For an infinite time horizon where
the price times the deflator goes to 0, the current price is
the expected value of discounted future cash flows, just as in
classical Graham and Dodd valuation.

A consequence of the above using the definitions of value and amount is
$$
	V_t D_t = E_t\bigl[V_v D_v + \sum_{t < u \le v}A_u D_u\bigr].
$$
Note the similarity to the previous displated equation.
Value
corresponds to price and amount corresponds to cash flow.
This is the skeleton key for valuing derivative securities.
It shows how dynamic trading creates synthetic market instruments.

__Proof__. If $u > t$ is sufficiently small then
$X_t D_t = E_t[(X_u + C_u) D_u]$ and $Δ_t + Γ_t = Δ_u$ 
$$
\begin{aligned}
	V_t D_t &= (Δ_t + Γ_t)\cdot X_t D_t\\
	        &= Δ_u\cdot E_t[(X_u + C_u) D_u]\\
	        &= E_t[(Δ_u\cdot X_u + Γ_u\cdot X_u + A_u) D_u] \\
	        &= E_t[(V_u + A_u)D_u],\\
\end{aligned}
$$
where we use $Δ_u\cdot C_u =  Γ_u\cdot X_u + A_u$.
The displayed formula above follows by induction.

For a trading strategy that closes out
$V_{τ_0} D_{τ_0} = E_{τ_0}[\sum_{t > τ_{0}}{A_{t}D_{t}] \ge 0}$. 
Since $V_{τ_0} = Γ_{τ_0} \cdot X_{τ_0}$, $A_{τ_0} = - Γ_{τ_0} \cdot X_{τ_0}$
and $D_{τ_0} > 0$ we have $A_{τ_0} \le 0$.
This proves the "easy" direction of the FTAP.

There is no need to prove the "hard" direction since we have a large supply of arbitrage free models.
All models of the form
$X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s \le t}{C_s D_s}$ where
$M_t:\AA_t \rightarrow \RR^{I}$ is a martingale and
$D_t:\AA_t \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ are arbitrage free.
This follows from substituting $X_v D_v = M_v - \sum_{u\le v} C_u D_u$
to obtain the arbitrage-free condition:
$$
\begin{aligned}
	E_t\bigl[X_v D_v + \sum_{t < u \le v} C_u D_u\bigr]
		&= E_t\bigl[M_v - \sum_{u\le v} C_u D_u + \sum_{t < u \le v} C_u D_u\bigr] \\
		&= E_t\bigl[M_v - \sum_{u\le t} C_u D_u \bigr] \\
		&= M_t - \sum_{u\le t} C_u D_u \\
		&= X_t D_t \\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

## Valuation

If a derivative security pays amounts $\bar{A}_j$ at times $\bar{τ}_j$ and there is
a hedge, $(\bar{Γ}_t)_{t\in T}$, that replicates these amounts then the value
of the derivative is the cost of setting up the initial hedge: $\bar{Γ}_0\cdot X_0$.
The hedge must satisfy $A_t = 0$ if $t ≠ \bar{τ}_j$ for all $j$ (_self financing_)
and $A_t = \bar{A}_j$ if $t = \bar{τ}_j$ for some $j$.
The formula $V_0 = E[\sum_j \bar{A}_j D_{\bar{τ}_j}]$ gives the
cost of the initial hedge since $V_0 = \bar{Γ}_0\cdot X_0$.

European options have a single payment, $\bar{A}_T$, at a fixed time
$T$ and have value $V_0 = E[\bar{A}_T D_T]$. Sometimes it is useful to
compute this as $E[\bar{A}_T D_T] = E^*[\bar{A}_T] E[D_T]$, where $E^*$
is the expected value under the probability measure defined by $dP^*/dP =
D_T/E[D_T]$. This is called the _forward measure_ at time $T$.

## Hedge

We can compute $V_0$ using derivative cash flows and the deflator.
Since $Γ_0\cdot X_0 = V_0$ the initial hedge is $Γ_0 = dV_0/dX_0$.

The hedge at time $t$ is similarly determined.
Since $(Δ_t + Γ_t)\cdot X_t = V_t$ we have $Δ_t + Γ_t =
dV_t/dX_t$, where the last term is the Fr&#233;chet derivative.  Since 
the position $Δ_t$ is known at time $t$ this determines the trades:
$Γ_t = dV_t/dX_t - Δ_t$.

In the continuous time case where stocks are modeled by geometric
Brownian motion, this becomes classical Black-Scholes/Merton
delta hedging where delta is $Δ$ and gamma is $Γ$. 
Under their mathematical assumptions the hedge perfectly replicates the derivative.

In the real world it is not possible to perfectly replicate the derivative
security.  It is the job of a quant to advise traders on when to hedge
and how to manage the associated risk of imperfect replication.

## Black-Scholes/Merton

The Black-Scholes/Merton model of a stock with no dividends
($C_t = 0$ for all $t$) is specified by the martingale
$M_t = (r, s\exp(\sigma B_t - \sigma^2t/2))$ and deflator
$D_t = \exp(-\rho t)$.  No need for Ito's
lemma, partial differential equations, or the Hahn-Banach theorem.

We can easily add fixed ($C_j = d_j$ constant) or proportional ($C_j = S_j p_j$) dividends.
Stock price "jumping" by dividend amount is a consequence of the model, not
ad hoc no arbitrage arguments.

## Canonical Deflator

There is a canonical choice for a deflator if repurchase agreements are available.

### Repurchase Agreement

Assume trades occur at discrete times, as they actually do,
so $T = \{t_j\}$ where $t_i < t_j$ if $i < j$.  
A _repurchase agreement_ at time $t_j$, $R_j$, has price $X^{R_j}_{t_j} = 1$
and cash flow $C^{R_j}_{t_{j+1}} = R_j$ so for any arbitrage free model
$D_{t_j} = E_{t_j}[R_j D_{t_{j+1}}]$.
We assume $D_{t_{j+1}}$ is $\mathcal{A}_{t_j}$ measurable so 
$D_{t_j} = R_j D_{t_{j+1}}$ and $D_{t_j} = \Pi_{j<n}
R_j^{-1}$ if $D_{t_0} = 1$.

Define the _forward repo rate_, $f_j$, by $R_j = \exp(f_j\,Δ t_j)$
where $Δ t_j = t_{j+1} - t_j$, so $D_{t_j} = \exp(-\sum_{j<n} f_j Δ_{t_j})$.
The continuous time version of the _canonical deflator_ is
$D_t = \exp(-\int_0^t f_s\,ds)$.

The price dynamics of all (non-risky) fixed income instruments are determined by the deflator.

### Futures

Futures contracts are typically traded on exchanges. The exchange specifies times $t_j$
for margin account adjustments.
The price of a futures contract is always 0 for any exchange customer with a
_margin account_ in good standing.
Each contract has an _underlying_ $S$ and an _expiration_ $T$. The futures _quote_
at time $t$, $Φ_t = Φ^{S,T}_t$, must satisfy $Φ_T = S_T$. Prior to that it is determined
by the limit and market orders traded on the exchange.
Futures have cash flows $C_{t_j} = Φ_{t_j} - Φ_{t_{j-1}}$ for $0 < j \le n$ and $C_{t_0} = 0$
where $t_0$ is the time the contract is entered.

In an arbitrage-free model $0 = E_{t_j}[(Φ_{t_{j+1}} - Φ_{t_j}) D_{t_{j + 1}}]$ so we
have $Φ_{t_j} = E_{t_j}[Φ_{t_{j+1}}]$ since $D_{t_{j + 1}}$ is $t_j$ measurable
and non-zero.
This shows futures quotes are martingales, at least at the adjustment times.
Assuming $Φ_t^{S,T} = E_t[S_T]$ for all $t \le T$ provides an arbitrage-free model
of futures quotes.

### Forward

A _forward_ contract on underlying $S$ with strike $k$ expiring at time $t$ 
pays $C_t = C_t^{S,k,t} = S_t - k$. It has initial value $V_0 = E[(S_t - k)D_t]
= S_0 - kE[D_t]$ in an arbitrage-free model.
The _par forward_, $f$, is the strike that makes the initial value equal to zero:
$0 = V_0 = E[(S_t - f)D_t]$ so $S_0 = fE[D_t]$. This formula is
called the _cost of carry_.

### Put-Call Parity

The first thing every trader checks when using a new model is _put-call
parity_.  A (European) _put option_ on underlying $S$ with strike $k$
expiring at time $t$ pays $C^p_t = \max\{k - S_t,0\}$ at $t$.  A _call
option_ on underlying $S$ with strike $k$ expiring at time $t$ pays
$C^c_t = \max\{S_t - k, 0\}$ at $t$.  Since $C^c_t - C^p_t = S_t - k$
we have $V^c_0 - V^p_0 = c - p = S_0 - k E[D_t]$, where $c$ and $p$ are
the value of the call and put at time 0. Put-call parity holds for
any (arbitrage-free) model.

#### American Option

An American option with strike $k$ and expiration $t$ pays $C_τ$ at a
stopping time $τ\le t$ at the discretion of the option holder. In the
unified model this is represented by extending the sample space of the
underlying, $Ω$, to $Ω\times (0,t]$. The outcome $(ω,τ)\in Ω\times
(0,t]$ represents exercising at time $τ$ when $ω$ occurs. Note that the
model does not assume the option is exercised at the "optimal" time. In
practice, not every market participant does this.  Models should have
knobs that reflect reality and choosing the optimal stopping time
should not be implicit.

American options do not satisfy put-call parity in general. The exercise time of the put and
the call can be different.

### Zero Coupon Bond

A _zero coupon bond_, $D(u)$, pays one unit at maturity $u$ so
$C^{D(u)}_u = 1$ is the only cash flow.  We write $D_t(u)$ for the price
$X_t^{D(u)}$ of the zero coupon bond at time $t$.  An arbitrage free
model requires the price at time $t$ to satisfy $D_t(u)D_t = E_t[D_u]$
so $D_t(u) = E_t[D_u]/D_t$.

In the continuous time case
the forward curve, $f(u)$, is defined by $D_0(u) = \exp(-\int_0^u f(s)\,ds)$.
The forward curve at time $t$, $f_t(u)$, is defined by $D_t(u) = \exp(-\int_t^u f_t(s)\,ds)$.

A _risky zero coupon bond_ with _recovery_ $R$ and _default time_ $T$
has a single cash flow $C_u = 1$ if default occurs after maturity or
$C_T = R$ if $T \le u$. It is customary to assume $R$ is constant.
As with American options, we must expand the sample space to $Ω\times (0,\infty]$
where $(ω,t)\in Ω\times (0,\infty]$ indicates default occurred at time $t$.
The partition of $(0,\infty]$ representing information available at time $t$ for the default time is
$\{(t,\infty]\} \cup \{\{s\}:s \le t\}$:
if default has not occurred prior to $t$ we only know $T > t$;
if default occurred prior to time $t$ we know exactly when it happened.

We write $D_t^{R,T}(u)$ for the price $X_t^{D^{R,T}(u)}$ of the risky zero coupon bond at time $t$.
The dynamics of a risky zero are determined by
$$
	D_t^{R,T}(u) D_t = E_t[R 1(T \le u) D_T + 1(T > u) D_u].
$$
The _credit spread_ $s_t = s_t^{R,T}(u)$ defined by $D_t^{R,T}(u) = D_t(u) e^{-u s_t}$
incorporates both recovery and default.

If rates are zero then $D_t = 1$ for all $t$ and this simplifies to
$D_0^{R,T}(u) = R P(T \le u) + P(T > u)$ when $t = 0$. If $T$ is 
exponentially distributed with hazard rate $λ$ then $P(T > t) = e^{-λ t}$ and
$$
	D_0^{R,T}(u) = R + (1 - R)e^{-λu}.
$$
When $λ = 0$ the right hand side is 1.
When $R = 0$ the credit spread equals the hazard rate.
If $λu$ is small then the approximation
$e^x \approx 1 + x$ for small $x$ gives the rule of thumb
$s = λ(1 - R)$ where $s = s_0 = s_0^{R,T}(u)$ is the credit spread at time 0.

For general $t$ we have
$$
	D_t^{R,T}(u) = R P(T \le u | T > t) 1(t < T \le u) + P(T > u | T > t) 1(T > u).
$$

Unlike in the credit default swap market, mathematical finance literature likes to
assume recovery is delayed until maturity. It is also popular to make the unrealistic
assumption that default time is independent of the deflator. Under these assumptions
we have
$$
	D_t^{R,T}(u) = D_t(u)\bigl(R P(T \le u | T > t) 1(t < T \le u) + P(T > u | T > t) 1(T > u)\bigr).
$$
In principal $R$ could be random and joint distributions involving the default time
and deflators could be specified, but computations become more difficult.

See [Fixed Income](fi.html) for details on how the deflator determines
the dynamics of instruments.

## Remarks

The price of an instrument is not a number.
Prior to a trade being executed, it depends on
what instrument is being exhanged in the trade,
the amount being purchased, and the legal entities involved.

The atoms of finance are _holdings_ $(a,i,e)$ indicating
entity $e$ owns amount $a$ of instrument $i$.
A _trade_ involves the exchange of holdings at some time:
$(t;a,i,c;a',i',c')$
where $t$ is the time of the exchange, $a$ is the amount
of instrument $i$ the _buyer_, $e$, exchanges for the amount
$a'$ in instrument $i'$ from the _seller_, $e'$.
The _price_ of the trade is $X = a/a'$ after the fact.

Price can be modeled more realistically as
a function $X\colon T\times A\times I\times E\times I\times E\to \RR$,
where $T$ is the set of trading times, $A$ is the set of amounts that can be
traded, $I$ is the set of market instruments, and $E$ is the set of legal
entities.  At time $t$ the trade $(t;a'X_t,i,e;a',i',e')$,
where $X_t = X_t(a',i,e,i',e')$,
is available to the buyer.  The seller $e'$ specifies the price $X_t$.
The buyer $e$ decides when to trade.
After the trade the buyer holds $(a', i', e)$ and the seller
holds $(a'X_t, i, e')$.

### One-Period Model

In the one-period model $T = \{t_0, t_1\}$ and we let $x = X_{t_0}$, $X = X_{t_1}$.
The cost of acquiring $γ$ shares of each instrument at the beginning
of the period is $γ\cdot x$. If that is negative then you make money.
At the end of the period you close the position by selling all of your
shares.  This results in a cash flow of $γ\cdot X$ to your account.
If that is non-negative then you don't lose money.  A one period model
has _arbitrage_ if there exists $γ\in \RR^I$ with
$γ\cdot x < 0$ and $γ\cdot X(\omega)\ge0$, $\omega\in\Omega$.

The one-period Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing states that there is no
arbitrage if and only if there exists a positive measure $\Pi$ on $\Omega$
such that $x = \int_\Omega X\,d\Pi$. If such a measure exists and
$γ\cdot X\ge 0$ then $γ\cdot x \ge 0$, so there is no arbitrage.

**Lemma.** _If $x\in\bm{R}^n$ and $C$ is a closed cone in
$\bm{R}^n$ with $x\not\in C$ then there exists $ξ\in\bm{R}^n$
with $ξ\cdot x < 0$ and $ξ\cdot y \ge0$ for $y\in C$._

Recall that a _cone_ is a subset of a vector space closed under addition
and multiplication by a positive scalar, that is, $C + C\subseteq C$
and $tC\subseteq C$ for $t > 0$.
For example, the set of arbitrage positions is a cone.

_Proof._ Since $C$ is closed and convex there exists $x^*\in C$ with
$0 < ||x^* - x|| \le ||y - x||$ for all $y\in C$.  Let $ξ = x^* - x$.
For any $y\in C$ and $t > 0$ we have $ty + x^*\in C$ so $||ξ|| \le ||ty + ξ||$. 
Simplifying gives $t^2||y||^2 + 2tξ\cdot y\ge 0$. 
Dividing by $t > 0$ and letting $t$ decrease to 0 shows $ξ\cdot y\ge 0$. 
Take $y = x^*$ then $tx^* + x^*\in C$ for $t \ge -1$. By similar reasoning,
letting $t$ increase to 0 shows $ξ\cdot x^*\le 0$ so $ξ\cdot x^* = 0$. 
Since $0 < ||ξ||^2 = ξ\cdot (x^* - x) = -ξ\cdot x$ we have $ξ\cdot x < 0$.
$\blacksquare$

The set of non-negative finitely additive measures is a closed
cone and $X\mapsto \int_\Omega X\,d\Pi$ is positive, linear, and continuous
so $C = \{\int_\Omega X\,d\Pi \mid \Pi\ge 0\}$ is also a closed cone.
The contrapositive of the FTAP follows from the lemma.

Note that the lemma is a purely geometric fact that does not involve the
actual probability of anything.
It is also called Farkas' lemma and is a special case of the Hahn-Banach theorem
in finite dimensional space.

The proof also shows how to find an arbitrage when one exists.

If a zero coupon bond exists, i.e., there is a $ζ\in\RR^I$ with
$ζ\cdot X(ω) = 1$ for all $ω\in Ω$, then
$ζ\cdot x = \int_Ω ζ\cdot X\,d\Pi = ||\Pi||$ is the price
of the zero coupon bond and $P = Π/ζ\cdot x$ is a probability measure.
The _discount_ is $D = ζ\cdot x$ and we get the
formula $x = E[X]D$ for current price equaling the expected
value of the discounted future price.

### One Period Model Again

Recall the _dual_ of the space of bounded
functions on a set $Ω$, $B(Ω)$, is the space of finitely additive
measures on $Ω$, $ba(Ω)$.

Let's assume $X_1\in B(Ω,\RR^I)$, the set of bounded functions from
$Ω$ to $\RR^I$. Consider the map $A\colon \RR \oplus B(Ω)\to\RR^2$
defined by $Γ \mapsto (-Γ\cdot X_0, Γ\cdot X_1)$. No arbitrage
says the range of $A$ does not intersect the cone $\{p \oplus P):p > 0, P\ge 0\}$.
Since the cone has an interior point, the Hahn-Banach theorem implies there exists
a hyperplane that does not intersect the cone. The hyperplane is the kernel of
an element in the dual space $B^* = \RR\oplus ba(Ω)$, where
$ba(Ω)$ is the space of finitely additive measures. Call this element

## Notation

If $\AA$ is an
[_algebra_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets)
on the set $Ω$ we write
$X\colon\AA\to\RR$ to indicate $X\colonΩ\to\RR$
is $\AA$-[_measurable_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function).
If $\AA$ is finite then the
[_atoms_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(measure_theory))
of $\AA$ form a
[_partition_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set)
of $Ω$ and being measurable is
equivalent to being constant on atoms. In this case $X$ is indeed a function
on the atoms.

If $\AA$ is an algebra of sets, the
[_conditional expectation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_expectation)
of $X$ given
$\AA$ is defined by $Y = E\left\lbrack X | \AA\right\rbrack$ if and only
if $Y$ is $\AA$ measurable and $\int_A Y\,dP = \int_A X\,dP$
for all $A\in\AA$. This is equivalent to $Y(P|_{\AA})
= (XP)|_{\AA}$ where the vertical bar indicates restriction of a measure.
In particular, $E[X|\mathcal{A}](ω) = \sum \{X(α) P(α): α\subseteq ω, α\in\AA\}$

A _filtration_ indexed by $T\subseteq [0,\infty)$ is an increasing
collection of algebras, $(\AA_t)_{t\in T}$.  A process
$M_{t}\colon\AA_{t} \rightarrow \RR$, $t\in T$, is
a _martingale_ if $M_t = E[M_u | \AA_t] = E_t[M_u]$ for $t\le u$.

A _stopping time_ is a function $τ\colonΩ\to T$ such that
$\{ω\inΩ\mid τ(ω) \le t\}$ belongs to $\AA_t$, $t\in T$.

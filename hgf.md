Fasten your seatbelt. 

By Taylor's theorem, every sufficiently well-behaved function on the real numbers
has a power series representation $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f^{n}(0) x^n/n!$
around $x = 0$, where $f^{n}(x)$ denotes the $n$-th derivative of $f$.
Perhaps the most well-known is the exponential function
with power series representation $\exp(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n/n!$.

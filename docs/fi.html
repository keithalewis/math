<h2>Fixed Income</h2>
<p>A <em>fixed income</em> instrument is specified by cash flows <span
class="math inline">(c_j)</span> at times <span
class="math inline">(u_j)</span>. This is just a portfolio of zero
coupon bonds so its <em>present value</em> is <span
class="math inline">P = \sum_j c_j D(u_j)</span> where <span
class="math inline">D(u)</span> is the discount to time <span
class="math inline">u</span>. The present value at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> is <span class="math inline">P_t =
\sum_{u_j &gt; t} c_j D_t(u_j)</span> where <span
class="math inline">D_t(u)</span> is the price at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> of a zero coupon bond maturing at <span
class="math inline">u</span>.</p>
<section id="zero-coupon-bond" class="level3">
<h3>Zero Coupon Bond</h3>
<p>A <em>zero coupon bond</em>, <span class="math inline">D(u)</span>,
pays one unit at maturity <span class="math inline">u</span> so <span
class="math inline">C^{D(u)}_u = 1</span> is the only cash flow. We
write <span class="math inline">D_t(u)</span> for the price <span
class="math inline">X_t^{D(u)}</span> of the zero coupon bond at time
<span class="math inline">t</span>. An arbitrage free model with
deflator <span class="math inline">D_t</span> requires the price at time
<span class="math inline">t</span> to satisfy <span
class="math inline">D_t(u)D_t = E_t[D_u]</span> so <span
class="math display">
    D_t(u) = E_t[D_u]/D_t.
</span></p>
<p>We can write <span class="math inline">D_t = \exp(-\int_0^t
f_s\,ds)</span> where <span class="math inline">f_t</span> is the
<em>continuously compounded forward rate</em>, or <em>short rate</em>
process. It corresponds to repurchase agreement rates.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show <span class="math inline">D_t(u)
= E_t[\exp(-\int_t^u f(s)\,ds)]</span></em>.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of fixed income is that the short rate
determines the price dynamics of all instruments, assuming there are no
defaults.</p>

<section id="discount-curve" class="level2">
<h2>Discount Curve</h2>
<p>Suppose a fixed income instrument pays cash flows <span
class="math inline">(c_k)</span> at times <span
class="math inline">(u_k)</span>. The <em>yield</em>, <span
class="math inline">y(p)</span>, given a price <span
class="math inline">p</span> is determined by <span
class="math inline">p = \sum_k c_k e^{-y(p)u_k}</span>. It is the
constant forward curve that reprices the fixed income instrument. It is
a convenient proxy for price, just like Black-Scholes/Merton implied
volatility.</p>
<p>It is not the case zero coupon bonds of all maturities are traded.
The <em>discount curve</em> <span class="math inline">D(t)</span> is
used to interpolate a discount for all maturities. An instrument with
cash flows <span class="math inline">(c_k)</span> at times <span
class="math inline">(u_k)</span> and price <span
class="math inline">p</span> <em>fits</em> the curve if <span
class="math inline">p = \sum_k c_k D(u_k)</span>. Typically a collection
of such intruments and prices are given and we wish to find a discount
curve that fits all of them. This is a highly underdetermined problem
and there is a vast literature on various methods of interpolation. The
simplest approach is to use market data directly and avoid non-financial
artifacts introduced by various splining methods.</p>
<section id="bootstrap" class="level3">
<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
<p>Given a collection of fixed income instruments ordered by increasing
maturity and corresponding prices we can bootstrap a discount curve
having a piecewise constant forward curve that matches each price. The
first forward is the yield of the first instrument. Given a discount to
time <span class="math inline">t</span> and a forward rate <span
class="math inline">f</span> we can extend the discount for <span
class="math inline">u &gt; t</span> by <span class="math inline">D(u) =
D(t)e^{-f(u - t)}</span>.</p>
<p>The bootstrap method is deterministic. It assumes the forward curve
is piecewise constant with jumps at maturities of instruments used to
build the curve. As instruments of increasing maturity are added, the
initial part of the curve is fixed and the new constant segment is
chosen to match the price of the instrument being added. It is important
that no two instruments have nearly equal maturity since the forward
between those dates may require a large adjustment to fit the price.</p>
<p>The vast literature on various methods of interpolating discount
curves should be ignored. Splining introduces mathematical artifacts
into the discount. A cubic Hermite tension spline can produce a forward
curve that is pleasing to the eye, but makes it difficult to explain to
a trader why their rho bucketing is off. It is better to add synthetic
instruments at intermediate maturities with prices determined by an
interpolation method that traders can understand. Curves should be
bootstrapped with the instruments traders are using to hedge their
position.</p>
<p>A piecewise constant curve is determined by times <span
class="math inline">(t_j)</span>, <span class="math inline">0\le j\le
n</span>, and forwards <span class="math inline">(f_j)</span>, <span
class="math inline">0 &lt; j \le n</span>, where <span
class="math inline">f(t) = f_j</span> for <span
class="math inline">t_{j-1} &lt; t \le t_j</span>. Note <span
class="math inline">f(t_j) = f_j</span> and the curve is undefined for
<span class="math inline">t &gt; t_n</span>. We assume <span
class="math inline">t_0 = 0</span> so <span class="math inline">(t_j,
f_j)</span>, <span class="math inline">1\le j\le n</span>, determine the
curve.</p>
<p>Given a forward curve to time <span class="math inline">t_n</span>
and an instrument with maturity <span class="math inline">t &gt;
t_n</span> we must find <span class="math inline">f</span> such that
<span class="math display">
    p = \sum_{u_k \le t_n} c_k D(u_k) + \sum_{u_k &gt; t_n} c_k
D(t_n)e^{-f(u_k - t_n)}
</span> where <span class="math inline">p</span> is the instrument
price. The discount <span class="math inline">D(u)</span> is determined
for <span class="math inline">u \le t_n</span> and the forward <span
class="math inline">f</span> is constant for <span class="math inline">u
&gt; t_n</span>. This can be solved using one-dimensional root finding
to produce the next point <span class="math inline">(t_{n+1}, f_{n+1}) =
(t, f)</span> of the piecewise constant forward curve where <span
class="math inline">t</span> is the maturity of the added instument.</p>
<p>If there is exactly one cash flow past <span
class="math inline">t_n</span>, <span class="math inline">(c, u)</span>,
then this equation has a closed form solution since the second sum has
only one term <span class="math inline">c D(t_n)e^{-f(u - t_n)}</span>.
Denoting the first sum by <span class="math inline">p_n</span> we have
<span class="math display">
    f = \frac{-\log((p - p_n)/c D(t_n))}{u - t_n}
</span> given price <span class="math inline">p</span> to produce the
next point <span class="math inline">(t_{n+1}, f_{n+1}) = (u,
f)</span>.</p>
<p>If we extend the curve with an instrument having exactly two cash
flows <span class="math inline">(c_0, u_0)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(c_1, u_1)</span> then there are also closed form
solutions. Since <span class="math inline">u_1 &gt; t_n</span> we have
two cases, <span class="math inline">u_0 \le t_n</span> and <span
class="math inline">u_0 &gt; t_n</span>. If <span
class="math inline">u_0 \le t_n</span> then <span
class="math inline">D(u_0)</span> is known and we have <span
class="math inline">p = p_n + c_0 D(u_0) + c_1 D(t_n)e^{-f(u_1 -
t_n)}</span> so <span class="math display">
    f = \frac{-\log((p - p_n - c_0 D(u_0))/c_1 D(t_n))}{u_1 - t_n}.
</span> If <span class="math inline">u_0 &gt; t_n</span> we have <span
class="math inline">p = p_n + c_0 D(t_n)e^{-f(u_0 - t_n)} + c_1
D(t_n)e^{-f(u_1 - t_n)}</span>.</p>

<section id="forward-rate-agreement" class="level3">
<h3>Forward Rate Agreement</h3>
<p>A <em>forward rate agreement</em> <span
class="math inline">F^{f,δ}(u,v)</span> over the period <span
class="math inline">[u, v]</span> with coupon <span
class="math inline">f</span> and <em>day count basis</em> <span
class="math inline">δ</span> pays <span class="math inline">-1</span>
unit at the <em>effective date</em> <span class="math inline">u</span>,
and <span class="math inline">1 + fδ(u,v)</span> at the <em>termination
date</em> <span class="math inline">v</span>, where <span
class="math inline">δ(u,v)</span> is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention"><em>day count
fraction</em></a> for the period. The day count fraction is
approximately equal to the time in years between <span
class="math inline">u</span> and <span class="math inline">v</span> for
any day count basis.</p>
<p>The <em>forward par coupon</em> at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>, <span
class="math inline">F_t^{f,δ}(u,v)</span> is the coupon that makes the
price at time <span class="math inline">t\le u</span> equal to <span
class="math inline">0</span>. Since <span class="math inline">0 =
E_t[-D_u + (1 + F_t^δ(u,v)δ(u,v))D_v]</span> the par coupon is <span
class="math display">
    F_t^δ(u,v) = (D_t(u)/D_t(v) - 1)/δ(u,v).
</span> Writing <span class="math inline">F_t = F_t^δ(u,v)</span> and
<span class="math inline">δ = δ(u,v)</span> we have <span
class="math display">
    E_t[F_tδ D_v] = F_tδ E_t[D_v] = E_t[D_u - D_v] = D_t(u) - D_t(v)
</span></p>
<p>There are also forward rate agreements not involving the exchange of
notional. A (fixed rate) <em>payer</em> FRA has the single cash flow
<span class="math inline">(f - F_u^δ(u,v))δ(u,v)</span> at time <span
class="math inline">v</span>. A <em>receiver</em> FRA has the negative
of this cash flow. The value at any time <span class="math inline">t \le
u</span> is determined by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
V_t D_t &amp;= E_t[(f - F_u(u,v;δ))δ(u,v) D_v] \\
        &amp;= E_t[fδ(u,v) D_v - E_u[D_u - D_v]]  \\
        &amp;= E_t[fδ(u,v) D_v - D_u + D_v]  \\
        &amp;= E_t[-D_u + (1 + fδ(u,v)) D_v] \\
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>which is the same as for a forward rate agreement that does exchange
notional. These two types of FRAS’s have very different risk
characteristics. If either counter-party defaults during the time
notionals are exchanged the loss can be much larger than when the
payment is only the difference of the fixed and floating rate.</p>

<h3>Interest Rate Swap</h3>
<p>An <em>interest rate swap</em> <span class="math inline">F^{c,δ}(t_0,
\ldots, t_n)</span> with <em>calculation dates</em> <span
class="math inline">(t_j)</span>, coupon <span
class="math inline">c</span>, and day count basis <span

class="math inline">t_j</span>, <span class="math inline">0 &lt; j &lt;
n</span>, and <span class="math inline">1 + cδ(t_{n-1},t_n)</span> at
<em>termination</em> <span class="math inline">t_n</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>swap par coupon</em> at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>, <span
class="math inline">F_t(t_0,\ldots,t_n;δ)</span>, is the coupon that
makes the price at time <span class="math inline">t\le {t_0}</span>
equal to <span class="math inline">0</span>: <span class="math display">
0 = E_t[-D_{t_0} + \sum_{0&lt;j&lt;n} F_tδ(t_{j-1},t_j) D_{t_j} + (1 +
F_tδ(t_{n-1},t_n) D_{t_n}].
</span> Hence the par coupon, <span
class="math inline">F_t(t_0,\ldots,t_n;δ) = (D_t(t_0) -
D_t(t_n))/\sum_{0&lt;j\le n}δ(t_{j-1},t_j) D_t(t_j)</span>, is
determined by zero coupon bond prices.</p>
<p>Note that if <span class="math inline">n = 1</span> this is identical
to a forward rate agreement.</p>
<p>There are also interest rate swaps not involving the exchange of
notional. A (fixed rate) <em>payer</em> has the cash flows <span
class="math inline">(c - F_{t_j}(t_{j-1},t_j;δ))δ(t_{j-1},t_j)</span> at
times <span class="math inline">t_j</span>, <span class="math inline">0
&lt; j \le n</span>. A <em>receiver</em> has the negative of these cash
flow.</p>
<p>As with forward rate agreements, the coupon making the value at time
<span class="math inline">t</span> equal to zero is the swap par
coupon.</p>

<h3>LIBOR Market Model</h3>

<h2>Risky Bonds</h2>
<p>A <em>risky zero coupon bond</em> with <em>recovery</em> <span

class="math inline">C_u = 1</span> if default occurs after maturity or
<span class="math inline">C_T = R</span> if <span class="math inline">T
\le u</span>. It is customary to assume <span
class="math inline">R</span> is constant. As with American options, we
must expand the sample space to <span class="math inline">Ω\times
(0,\infty]</span> where <span class="math inline">(ω,t)\in Ω\times
(0,\infty]</span> indicates default occured at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>. The partition of <span
class="math inline">(0\infty]</span> representing information available
at time <span class="math inline">t</span> for the default time is <span
class="math inline">\{(t,\infty]\} \cup \{\{s\}:s \le t\}</span>. If
default has not occured prior to <span class="math inline">t</span> we
only know <span class="math inline">T &gt; t</span>. If default occured
prior to time <span class="math inline">t</span> we know exactly when it
happened.</p>
<p>We write <span class="math inline">D_t^{R,T}(u)</span> for the price
<span class="math inline">X_t^{D^{R,T}(u)}</span> of the risky zero
coupon bond at time <span class="math inline">t</span>. The dynamics of
a risky zero are determined by <span class="math display">
    D_t^{R,T}(u) D_t = E_t[R 1(T \le u) D_T + 1(T &gt; u) D_u].
</span> The <em>credit spread</em> <span class="math inline">s_t =
s_t^{R,T}(u)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">D_t^{R,T}(u) =

<p>If rates are zero then <span class="math inline">D_t = 1</span> for
all <span class="math inline">t</span> and this simplifies to <span
class="math inline">D_0^{R,T}(u) = R P(T \le u) + P(T &gt; u)</span>
when <span class="math inline">t = 0</span>. If <span

</span> When <span class="math inline">λ = 0</span> the right hand side
is 1. When <span class="math inline">R = 0</span> the credit spread

thumb <span class="math inline">s = λ(1 - R)</span> where <span

<p>For general <span class="math inline">t</span> we have <span

u | T &gt; t) 1(T &gt; u).
</span></p>
<p>Unlike in the credit default swap market, mathematical finance
literture likes to assume recovery is delayed until maturity. It is also
popular to make the unrealistic assumption that default time is
independent of the deflator. Under these assumptions we have <span

    D_t^{R,T}(u) = D_t(u)\bigl(R P(T \le u | T &gt; t) 1(t &lt; T \le u)
+ P(T &gt; u | T &gt; t) 1(T &gt; u)\bigr).
</span> In principal, <span class="math inline">R</span> could be random
and joint distributions involving the default time and deflators could
be specified.</p>

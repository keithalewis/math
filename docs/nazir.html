<p>Thank you for spending time thinkng about what I sent you. I’ve been
spending time thinking about what you sent me. We probably have a
different notion of what a cash flow is. The wonderful thing about math
is that it is possible to get to the bottom of propositions that are
either true of false. The trick is to come up with statements other
mathematicians find interesting. If you think what I have to say is not
interesting, just let me know so I don’t waste your time.</p>
<p>I hope you don’t mind me sharing some history with Peter Carr. You
took over from him and are in a positon to decide how to run your
program. When I asked him about what to teach in the curriculum he
always gave me the same answer, “Will it help students get jobs?” I’m
not interested in publishing papers. My passion is thinking clearly
about prior reseach and making that accesible to students</p>
<p>Peter and I had a falling out after he hired me at Banc of America
Securities. I’m sure you have run into the pressures involved with
working for Big Banks. Time heals all wounds and we eventually got back
on good terms.</p>
<p>He, Carol, and Olivia moved into my neighborhood after he left Morgan
Stanley and started at Tandon. We would meet at the latest coffee shop
to open on Smith Street to discuss mathematical finance, and his
travails at Tandon.</p>
<p>He ran into trouble with Johnett and did not understand the control
unions have at NYU. Barry set him staight on that. You seem to have
figured out he is a gem. Peter got me positions at Courant, Cornell,
Rutgers, and Tandon. Barry has a knack for figuring out the best
students.</p>

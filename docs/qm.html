<h2>Holding, Portfolio, Exchange, Transaction</h2>
<p>A <em>(legal) entitiy</em> is a person or corporation that can own
financial instruments.</p>
<p>A <em>holding</em> is a triple <span class="math inline">h = (a, i,
o)</span> indicating amount <span class="math inline">a</span> of
instrument <span class="math inline">i</span>. is held by owner <span
class="math inline">o</span>. A <em>portfolio</em> is a collection of
holdings. Holdings are the atoms of finance.</p>
<p>An <em>atomic transaction</em>, or <em>switch</em>, is a triple <span
class="math inline">\chi = (t, h, h&#39;)</span> where <span
class="math inline">t</span> is the time the <em>buyer</em> holding
<span class="math inline">h</span> is exchanged with the <em>seller</em>
holding <span class="math inline">h&#39;</span>. Both buyers and sellers
are owners.</p>
<p>A switch results in the portfolio of the buyer <span
class="math inline">o</span> changing from <span
class="math inline">\{\ldots,(a,i,o),\ldots\}</span> to <span
class="math inline">\{\ldots,(a&#39;,i&#39;,o),\ldots\}</span> and the
portfolio of the seller <span class="math inline">o&#39;</span> changing
from <span
class="math inline">\{\ldots,(a&#39;,i&#39;,o&#39;),\ldots\}</span> to
<span class="math inline">\{\ldots,(a,i,o&#39;),\ldots\}</span>. The
amount of each instrument is switched between the buyer and seller.
Sellers passively offer potential exchanges and buyers actively decide
which to accept. Both buyers and sellers can buy/go long (amount is
positive) or sell/go short (amount is negative).</p>
<p>A <em>transaction</em> is a collection of related switches involving,
e.g., fees or taxes. Transactions are the molecules of finance.</p>
<p>The <em>price</em> of a switch is <span class="math inline">X =
a/a&#39;</span> where <span class="math inline">h = (a, i, o)</span> and
<span class="math inline">h&#39; = (a&#39;, i&#39;, o&#39;)</span>. If a
buyer pays <span class="math inline">(8, \$)</span> for <span
class="math inline">(2, \text{F})</span> shares of Ford stock then the
price is <span class="math inline">8/2 = 4</span> dollars per share.
Typically <span class="math inline">i</span> is the preferred currency
of the buyer.</p>
<p>There is no uncertainty in the price of a switch. It is simply a
number entered into the books and records of each owner.</p>
<p>If a seller offers a price <span class="math inline">X</span> at time
<span class="math inline">t</span> for buyers to exchange instrument
<span class="math inline">i&#39;</span> for instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span> then it is approximately correct that the
switch <span class="math inline">\chi = (t,(X a&#39;, i, o),
(a&#39;,i&#39;,o&#39;))</span> is available to a buyer wanting to
acquire <span class="math inline">a&#39;</span> of seller’s instrument
<span class="math inline">i&#39;</span>. If the buyer wants to buy <span
class="math inline">a&#39; &gt; 0</span> of <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span> then the seller price <span
class="math inline">X</span> will be the <em>ask</em>. As <span
class="math inline">a&#39;</span> becomes a larger positive number, the
ask will increase. If the buyer want to sell <span
class="math inline">a&#39; &lt; 0</span> of <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span> then the seller price <span
class="math inline">X</span> will be the <em>bid</em>. As <span
class="math inline">a&#39;</span> becomes a larger negative number, the
bid will decrease.</p>
<p>The price a seller quotes can also depend on the buyer but in all
cases the price recorded in books and records will be <span
class="math inline">X = a/a&#39;</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">i</span> is assumed to be the preferred
buyer currency, <span class="math inline">i&#39;</span> is a particular
seller instrument, and we lump all buyers into <span
class="math inline">o</span> and all sellers into <span
class="math inline">o&#39;</span> then market orders can be modeled as a
sequence <span class="math inline">(t_j, a_j&#39;)</span> of times and
amounts of instrument <span class="math inline">i&#39;</span> acquired
by the buyer. The buyer pays <span class="math inline">a_j = a_j&#39;
X_j</span> in the preferred currency to the seller where <span
class="math inline">X_j</span> is the price of the switch.</p>

<h2>Order Book</h2>
<p>An <em>order book</em> is a collection of limit orders. A limit order
is a quintuple <span class="math inline">(t, l, a, i, o)</span>
indicating that owner <span class="math inline">o</span> is willing to
buy amount <span class="math inline">a &gt; 0</span> or sell amount
<span class="math inline">a &lt; 0</span> of instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span> at price <span class="math inline">l</span>
any time after <span class="math inline">t</span>. Limit orders can be
cancelled by the owner.</p>
<p>The <em>depth</em> at time <span class="math inline">t</span> for
level <span class="math inline">l</span> is the sum over the amount of
every limit orders placed prior to <span class="math inline">t</span>
having level <span class="math inline">l</span>. <span
class="math display">
    A(t, l) = \sum_{(t_j,l_j,a_j,i_j,o_j)} \{a_j\mid t_j &lt; t, l_j =
l\}.
</span> The <em>ask</em> is the lowest level with <span
class="math inline">A(t, l) &gt; 0</span>. The <em>bid</em> is the
highest level with <span class="math inline">A(t, l) &lt; 0</span>.</p>
<p>The order book can be represented by <span class="math display">
    B(t, l) = \sum_{a_j &gt; 0, t &gt; t_j} a_j 1(l &gt; l_j) +
\sum_{a_j &lt; 0, t &gt; t_j} a_j 1(l &lt; l_j)
</span> Note <span class="math inline">dB/dl = A</span> and the inverse
of <span class="math inline">B</span> is the usual representation for
order books.</p>
<p>TODO: explain better</p>
<p>Exchanges line up <em>liquidity providers</em> to seed the order book
prior to market open with limit orders. Exchange customers can also
place limit orders. Both liquidity providers and exchange customers can
execute market orders during trading hours.</p>
<p>A <em>market order</em> specifies the holding <span
class="math inline">(a, i, o)</span> that buyer <span
class="math inline">o</span> would like to obtain at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>. If the amount <span
class="math inline">a</span> is positive the limit orders at the ask
level are matched in priority of when they were placed and removed from
the order book. This may result in a transaction with multiple switches
having different limit owner orders.</p>
<p>If the depth at the ask is less than the amount <span
class="math inline">a</span> then the price will be the ask. If not,
limit orders at the next highest level will be matched. If their depth
is still less than the remaining amount the process repeats until the
entire buy is filled. This results in a transaction containing switches
for each level that was filled.</p>
<p>If the amount <span class="math inline">a</span> is negative the
limit orders at the bid level are matched in priority of when they were
placed and removed from the order book. If the depth at the bid is less
than the amount <span class="math inline">a</span> then the price will
be the bid. If not, limit orders at the next lowest level will be
matched. If their depth is still less than the remaining amount the
process repeats until the entire sell is filled.</p>
<p>The usual representation is the inverse of <span
class="math inline">B</span> with level a function of amount.</p>
<p>A limit order placed at time <span class="math inline">t</span> will
eventually have price <span class="math inline">l</span>, but there is
no guarantee when, or if, it will get matched by a market orders. A
market order is immediately matched with existing limit orders, but its
price is uncertain. This is not unlike the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle.</p>
<p>The <em>ask</em> for a order book is the lowest level with positive
depth. The <em>bid</em> for a order book is the highest level with
negative depth. The <em>mid</em> is the average of the bid and ask. The
<em>high</em> over an interval is the largest trade price over the
interval. The <em>low</em> over an interval is the smallest trade price
over the interval. The <em>open</em> is the price of the first trade of
the session and the sign of the amount. The <em>close</em> is the price
of the last trade of the session and the sign of the amount.</p>

<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>Now that we have established rigorous definitions of order books and
market orders we will revisit the notation from the first section.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">(t_j, a_j&#39;)</span> be the market
orders where the times are increasing. Clearly <span
class="math inline">\Delta t_j = t_{j+1} - t_j</span> is the time
between trade <span class="math inline">j</span> and trade <span
class="math inline">j + 1</span>. Given two times <span
class="math inline">u &lt; v</span> the average time between trades in
<span class="math inline">[u, v]</span> is <span
class="math inline">\tau(u,v) = (\sum_{j=m}^n \Delta t_j)/(n - m +
1)</span> where the sum is over <span class="math inline">\Delta
t_j\subseteq [u,v]</span>.</p>
<p>The last price to trade at <span class="math inline">s_t</span> is
<span class="math inline">X_j = a_j/a_j&#39;</span> where <span
class="math inline">j = j(t) = \max \{i \mid t_i &lt; t\}</span>. We
write <span class="math inline">s_t^+</span> if traded at the ask and
<span class="math inline">s_t^-</span> if traded at the bid. The mid is
<span class="math inline">s_t = (s_t^+ + s_t^-)/2</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">m, M, q, Q</span>?</p>

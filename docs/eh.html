<p>It is expensive to write program that have no bugs. It is also
expensive to debug programs. This note endeavours to strke a happy
medium by suggesting simple ways of minimizing the number of bugs in a
program.</p>

<p><em>There are two ways to write code: write code so simple there are
obviously no bugs in it, or write code so complex that there are no
obvious bugs in it</em>. – Tony Hoare</p>

<h3>Factor Your Code</h3>
<p>Tony was right, “If it’s complicated, it’s wrong” is my mantra. Every
function should be succinct and do one thing. Spend some time thinking
about names so using code reads naturally.</p>
<p>C++ has functions and classes with member functions. Prefer
standalone functions to classes. If a function has some arguments that
do not change often then put those in the class constructor and call the
standalone function from a similarly named member function.</p>
<pre><code>// option.h - Fischer Black option greeks.

namespace option {

    // Return put value given forward, vol, strike, and time in years to expiration.
    double put_value(double f, double s, double k, double t);

    // Return derivative put of value with respect to forward.
    double put_delta(double f, double s, double k, double t);

    // Return second derivative of put value with respect to forward.
    double put_gamma(double f, double s, double k, double t);

    // Fischer Black European put option valuation and greeks.
    class put {
        double k, t;
    public:
        // A put is specified by its strike and time in years to expiration.
        put(double k, double t)
            : k(k), t(t)
        { }

        double value(double f, double s) const
        {
            return put_value(f, s, k, t);
        }
        double delta(double f, double s) const
        {
            return put_delta(f, s, k, t);
        }
        double gamma(double f, double s) const
        {
            return put_gamma(f, s, k, t);
        }
    };

} // namespace option</code></pre>
<p>Provide succinct and helpful comments for people using your code. And
for yourself when you reuse what you wrote at some point in the
future.</p>
<pre><code>#include &quot;option.h&quot;
...
double f = 100, s = 0.1, k = 100, t = 0.25;
double v = option::put_value(f, s, k, t);
option::put p(k, t);
double d = p.delta(f, s);</code></pre>
<p>Note how the function and class names document the single letter
names.</p>

<h3>Test Your Code</h3>
<p>Every function should have <em>unit tests</em>. C++ has an <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert"><code>assert</code></a>
macro. Use <code>assert(expression)</code> to ensure the expression
evalates to a non-zero value. If not, the macro prints the file name and
line number to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">standard error</a>
followed by the text of expression to the terminal running the program,
then calls <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/abort"><code>abort</code></a>.</p>
<p>It is not only a politically incorrect word these days, it brings the
program to a grinding halt and deposits a core dump.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
This is a good thing. The person writing the code and running the unit
test has to fix the bug before sauntering off to other tasks. Buggy code
must be forbidden to be checked into the source code management system.
The person writing buggy code must must be immediatley held accountable.
If not, someone else will have to spend time to figure out what they
wrote and why it is wrong. The person who wrote the buggy code is in the
best position to solve this, hopefully aided by code reviews from their
colleagues.</p>
<p>The best way to handle errors is to not have them.</p>
</section>
<section id="return-codes" class="level3">
<h3>Return Codes</h3>
<p>If you write a function people may call it with improper inputs. For
example, it is an error to call the function
<code>double sqrt(double x)</code> with <code>x &lt; 0</code>.</p>
<p>The way this was dealt with in C was to set a global
<code>errno</code> that users had to check after every call to
<code>sqrt</code>. This does not work well with multi-threaded
programs.</p>
<p>Programming languages should allow programmers to communicate what
they think should be correct to the code that will ultimately be
executed.</p>
<p><em>Error handling</em> is how a program running on a computer
communicates to the person using the program the mistakes the person who
wrote the program requested to be reported during execution.</p>
<p>Edsger Dijkstra wrote a letter to the editors of <em>Communications
of the ACM</em> in 1968 titled <a
href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7EEWD/transcriptions/EWD02xx/EWD215.html">“Go
To Statement Considered Harmful.”</a> He was (very much) concerned with
providing programmers appropriate tools for writing correct
programs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My second remark is that our intellectual powers are rather geared to
master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes
evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we
should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost best
to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic
process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in
text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as
possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Newton, I appreciate what people smarter than me spent their
precious time on this planet passionately figuring out and carefully
communicated to posterity. All I need to do is take the time to read the
words they wrote and make an effort to understand their hard-won
knowledge.</p>
<p>Dijkstra’s admonition led to the practice of functions returning
error codes instead of jumping to non-local code execution. The code
immediately after the function call checks the error code and takes
action based on that. This places a burden on the programmer of checking
all possible return codes.</p>
<p>C++ uses <em>exceptions</em> that <em>throw</em> up the function
<em>call stack</em>. A calling function in a better position to report
something hopefully useful to whoever is using the program can
<em>catch</em> and</p>
<p>In the “Design and Evolution of C++” Bjarne Stroustup reported his
findings based on a study of existing languages that tried to handle
exceptional behaviour during program execution. He found that trying to
write code to work around the exception led to more problems. It is
better to just report the exception and terminate the program with
useful information. It is a flaw in the program that needs to be fixed
by a human.</p>

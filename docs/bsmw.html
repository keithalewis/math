<p>The theory developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert C.
Merton III is wrong. Not just a little bit wrong, but wrong in a way no
Nobel Prize can redeem. Merton provided a closed-form solution for
barrier options using the reflection principle of Brownian motion. What
is the value of a barrier option that knocks in the second time the
barrier is hit? It is the same as a barrier option that knocks in the
millionth time it is hit. Don’t be like me and actually say that to a
trader. Charlie didn’t speak to me for 3 months after I made that
mathematically correct, but totally foolish claim. I managed to redeem
myself by helping him with some statistics he needed for his Fantasy
Football hobby.</p>
<p>This ridiculouness is a mathematical artifact of Merton learning the
Ito calculus at Cal Tech. It leads to the untenable notion of continuous
time trading. I have been guilty of teaching this nonsence to
unsuspecting students at NYU, Cornell, Rutgers, and Columbia in the
derivative securities I’ve taught. The way it works in the real world is
traders do only a finite number of trades.</p>
<p>It is time to put an end to this.</p>

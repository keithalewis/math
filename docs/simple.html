<div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
<p>Every arbitrage-free market model is parameterized by a vector-valued
martingale and a positive adapted process. There is no need to restrict
models to Ito processes, use partial differential equations, or consider
self-financing portfolios. There is also no need for utility functions
or market equilibrium. In fact, there is no need for probability
measures. The Unified Model involves only geometry, as was first pointed
out by Stephen Ross. We do need the notion of algebras of sets in order
to mathematically model partial information. Market participants can
only execute a finite number of trades. It is time to banish the
mathematical fiction of continuous time trading and focus on problems
practitioners find useful: when to re-hedge and what are the risk
trade-offs.</p>
</div>
</header>

<p>There is a clear trajectory in mathematical finance starting from
Black, Scholes, and Merton showing how to use a bond and a stock to
hedge an option. Ross showed how to extend this to any number of
instruments in the one-period case using a not quite correct application
of the Hahn-Banach theorem. This was fixed up and extended to
multi-period models. Credit and liquidity considerations were eventually
added.</p>
<p>This note supplies a mathematically rigorous approach to extend this
trajectory. and make model assumptions explicit. Large banks, money
management firms, and hedge funds need to consider cross market
correlations. Risk management has recognized market realities involving
large positions. Models must allow for the empirical fact that not all
market participants act optimally.</p>
<p>Scholes and Merton won a Nobel Prize for a new method of valuing
derivative securities that did not require estimating the return on the
underlying. Under the assumption that future stock prices could be
modeled by geometric Brownian motion and it was possible to trade in
continuous time, all one needed to know was the volatility.</p>
<section id="ross" class="level2">
<h2>Ross</h2>
<p>Stephen Ross expanded the Black, Scholes, and Merton theory to any
number of instruments in the one-period case. His Fundamental Theorem of
Asset pricing was a geometric result that could be proved using the
Hahn-Banach theorem. He posited that prices of <span
class="math inline">n</span> instruments at the beginning of the period
can be represented as a vector <span class="math inline">x\in ùëπ^n</span>
and the prices at the end of the period are functions of possible
outcomes <span class="math inline">\Omega</span> where <span
class="math inline">X\colon\Omega\to ùëπ^n</span> indicates prices <span
class="math inline">X(\omega)</span> at the end of the period if <span
class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span> occurred.</p>
<p>Arbitrage exists, for this model, if there is a <span
class="math inline">\gamma\in ùëπ^n</span> with <span
class="math inline">\gamma\cdot x &lt; 0</span> and <span
class="math inline">\gamma\cdot X(\omega)\ge0</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span>. This corresponds to a
trading strategy of purchasing <span class="math inline">\gamma</span>
shares at the beginning of the period and selling <span
class="math inline">\gamma</span> shares at the end of the period. The
cost of acquiring <span class="math inline">\gamma</span> shares at the
beginning of the period is <span class="math inline">\gamma\cdot
x</span>. If the cost is negative the strategy generates money on the
initial trades. Selling <span class="math inline">\gamma</span> shares
at the end of the period generates <span class="math inline">\gamma\cdot
X(\omega)</span> in value if <span
class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span> occurred. If this is
non-negative then there is an arbitrage: you make money entering the
trade and do not lose money when exiting.</p>
<p>He showed the one-period model is arbitrage-free if and only if <span
class="math inline">x</span> belongs to the smallest closed cone
containing the range of <span class="math inline">X</span>. This is
equivalent to <span class="math display">
    x = \int_\Omega X(\omega)\,d\Pi(\omega)
</span> for some positive measure <span class="math inline">\Pi</span>
on <span class="math inline">\Omega</span>. If <span
class="math inline">x</span> does not belong to the cone and <span
class="math inline">x^*</span> is the nearest point in the cone to <span
class="math inline">x</span> then <span class="math inline">\xi = x^* -
x</span> is an arbitrage portfolio.</p>
<p>The notion of <span class="math inline">\gamma\cdot x = 0</span> and
<span class="math inline">\gamma\cdot X</span> being positive with some
positive probability as a definition of arbitrage is ridiculous. How
positive will the profit be? What is the probability it will be
realized? Of course any trader or risk manager would compare the initial
profit <span class="math inline">-\gamma\cdot x</span> to the amount of
capital that would be involved, <span class="math inline">|\gamma|\cdot
|x|</span> before dragging in a probability measure.</p>
<p>A rigorous statement of Ross‚Äô theorem is that if <span
class="math inline">X</span> is bounded then there exists a finitely
additive measure <span class="math inline">\Pi</span> such that <span
class="math display">
    x = \int_\Omega X(\omega)\,d\Pi(\omega).
</span> If <span class="math inline">B(\Omega)</span> is the set of
bounded functions on <span class="math inline">\Omega</span> then its
<em>dual</em> is <span class="math inline">B(\Omega)^* =
ba(\Omega)</span>, the set of finitely additive measures on <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span>. Integration is a linear function from
<span class="math inline">B(\Omega)</span> to <span
class="math inline">ùëπ</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose there exists <span class="math inline">\zeta\in ùëπ^n</span>
with <span class="math inline">\zeta\cdot X = 1</span>. The market model
has a zero coupon bond paying 1 unit at the end of the period. It costs
<span class="math inline">\zeta\cdot x</span> at the beginning of the
period to get a certain cash flow of <span class="math inline">1</span>
at the end of the period. The <em>discount</em> over the period is <span
class="math display">
    D = \zeta\cdot x = \int_\Omega \zeta\cdot X\,d\Pi = \int_\Omega d\Pi
= \|\Pi\|,
</span> where <span class="math inline">\|\Pi\|</span> is the total mass
of <span class="math inline">\Pi</span> since <span
class="math inline">\Pi</span> is positive. It is true that <span
class="math inline">P = \Pi/\|\Pi\|</span> is a positive measure with
mass 1. Technically, it is a probability measure. But that does not mean
it represents the probability of any particular event occurring. It is
called the <em>risk neutral measure</em>, but a more accurate name is
<em>risk blind</em> measure. It provides no insight into real-world
probabilities.</p>
<p>We can write <span class="math inline">x = \int X\,d\Pi = \int
X\,d(\Pi/\|\Pi\|) \|\Pi\| = E[XD]</span> under the risk neutral measure.
The price at the beginning of the period is the expected value of the
discounted price at the end of he period.</p>
<p>Note that in any arbitrage-free model we have <span
class="math inline">x_i = E[X_iD]</span>, <span class="math inline">1\le
i\le n</span>. Every instrument has the same expected return</p>

<p>A collection of some fundamental facts everyone should be aware
of.</p>
<section id="algebras-of-sets" class="level3">
<h3>Algebras of Sets</h3>
<p>Algebras of sets are used to model partial information. If the
algebra is finite then the atoms form a partition. Complete information
is knowing the element of the set, partial information is knowing only
what atom it belongs to.</p>
<p>A sequence of coin flips can be modeled by the sample space of real
numbers between 0 and 1, <span class="math inline">\Omega =
[0,1)</span>. Every number <span
class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span> can be written as <span
class="math inline">\omega = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \omega_j 2^{-j}</span>
where <span class="math inline">\omega_j</span> is either 0 or 1. The
digits in the base 2 representation can be intrepreted as coin flips: 1
means heads and 0 means tails, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The first flip is determined by <span
class="math inline">\omega_1</span>. The partition <span
class="math inline">\{[0, 1/2),[1/2, 1)\}</span> of <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span> represents knowing the first flip. If
<span class="math inline">\omega_1 = 0</span> then <span
class="math inline">\omega\in[0,1/2)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\omega_1 =1</span> then <span
class="math inline">\omega\in[1/2,1)</span>. The partition <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}_n = \{[j2^{-n}, (j+1)2^{-n})\mid 0\le j
&lt; 2^n\}</span> represents knowing the first <span
class="math inline">n</span> flips.</p>
<p>A subsets of a sample space <span class="math inline">\Omega</span>
are called <em>events</em>. If we want to talk about event <span
class="math inline">E</span> <em>not</em> happening or both event <span
class="math inline">E</span> <em>and</em> <span
class="math inline">F</span> happended</p>

A <em>monad</em> is a <em>monoid</em> on the <em>endofunctors</em> of a
<em>category</em>.
</div>
</header>
<p>We communicate using vocabulary. Italicised words indicate terms you
may not be familiar with that will be defined later. I owe you
definitions for <em>monad</em>, <em>monoid</em>, <em>endofunctor</em>
and <em>category</em> but that requires going a bit deeper in debt
first. I am assuming you know the meaning of ‘a’, ‘is’, ‘on’, ‘the’, and
‘of’.</p>
<p>A monoid is a set with a <em>binary operation</em> that is
<em>associative</em> and has an <em>identity element</em>. A binary
operation on a set <span class="math inline">M</span> is a function
<span class="math inline">m\colon M\times M\to M</span>. It is
associative if <span class="math inline">m(m(a,b),c) = m(a,
m(b,c))</span>, <span class="math inline">a,b,c\in M</span>. If we write
<span class="math inline">m(a,b)</span> as <span
class="math inline">ab</span> this says <span class="math inline">(ab)c
= a(bc)</span> so we can write <span class="math inline">abc</span>
unambiguously. An identity element <span class="math inline">e\in
M</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">em = m = me</span>, for all
<span class="math inline">m\in M</span>.</p>
<p>A category is a collection of <em>arrows</em> with a <em>partial</em>
binary operation that is associative. Each arrow in the collection is
associatied with two <em>objects</em>, a <em>domain</em> and
<em>codomain</em>. For an arrow <span class="math inline">f</span> we
write <span class="math inline">f\colon A\to B</span> where <span
class="math inline">A = \operatorname{dom}f</span> is the domain and
<span class="math inline">B = \operatorname{cod}f</span> is the
codomain. If <span class="math inline">f</span> and <span
class="math inline">g</span> are arrows and <span
class="math inline">\operatorname{cod}f = \operatorname{dom}g</span>
then the partial binary operation <span class="math inline">gf</span> is
well-defined and called <em>composition</em>. Every object <span
class="math inline">A</span> has an <em>identity arrow</em> <span
class="math inline">1_A</span> that satisfies <span
class="math inline">1_{\operatorname{cod}f} f = f =
1_{\operatorname{dom}f}</span>.</p>
<p>A <em>functor</em> <span
class="math inline">F\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}</span> takes arrows
of the category <span class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span> to arrows
of category <span class="math inline">\mathcal{B}</span> and preserves
the category structure. If <span class="math inline">f\colon A\to
A&#39;</span> in <span class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span> then <span
class="math inline">F(f)\colon F(A)\to F(A&#39;)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{B}</span> and if <span
class="math inline">g\colon A&#39;\to A&#39;&#39;</span> then <span
class="math inline">F(gf) = F(g)F(f)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{B}</span> then <span
class="math inline">F</span> is an <em>endofunctor</em>.</p>
<p>A monad is a monoid on the endofunctors of a category.</p>
<section id="remarks" class="level2">
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>This is a complete and correct definition of a monad, if not
particularly enlightening.</p>
<p>The definition of a category is similar to that of a monoid except
the binary operation is not defined for all pairs of arrows.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>If a category has one object then it
is a monoid</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: The binary operation is defined for all arrows <span
class="math inline">f</span> since <span
class="math inline">\operatorname{dom}f</span> and <span
class="math inline">\operatorname{cod}f</span> are the one object.</p>
<p>If you already know something about category theory you might think
my definition is lacking. The usual definition states a category has
arrows and objects, but arrows have a domain and codomain. The identity
arrows determine the objects.</p>
<p>The usual definition of a functor states it also takes objects of the
first category to objects of the second.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show identity arrows are
unique</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: Show if <span class="math inline">f 1&#39;_A =
f</span> and <span class="math inline">1&#39;_A g</span> whenever <span
class="math inline">f\colon A\to B</span> and <span
class="math inline">g\colon B\to A</span> then <span
class="math inline">1&#39;_A = 1_A</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>If <span class="math inline">F</span>
is a functor then <span class="math inline">F(1_A) =
1_{F(A)}</span></em>.</p>
<p>Since identity arrows correspond to objects we also have an object
mapping.</p>
<p>The canonical example of a category is <span
class="math inline">\mathbf{Set}</span> where the arrows are functions
between sets. The category <span class="math inline">\mathbf{Mon}</span>
has objects monoids and arrows are <em>homomorphisms</em>, functions
that preserve the monoid operation.</p>
<p>Given a set <span class="math inline">S</span> let <span
class="math inline">S^*</span> be the set of all strings, finite length
lists, of elements of <span class="math inline">S</span>. This is a
monoid with binary operation concatenation and identity the empty list.
This defines a functor <span
class="math inline">F\colon\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Mon}</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>forGetful functor</em> <span
class="math inline">G\colon\mathbf{Mon}\to\mathbf{Set}</span> is the
identity functor that forgets the monoid structure. A monoid is a set
and a monoid homomorphism is a function.</p>
<p>The endofunctor <span
class="math inline">GF\colon\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Set}</span> is a
monad.</p>
<p>unit and counit</p>
<p>Monoids are quite common. Now that you know their mathematical
definition you, Baader, and Meinhof will start seeing them everywhere.
Examples of monoids are the set of real numbers with addition and
identity 0, multiplication and identity 1, maximum and identity <span
class="math inline">-\infty</span>, and minimum having identity <span
class="math inline">\infty</span>.</p>
<p>The binary operation for these examples is commutative. A
non-commutative example of a monoid is string concatenation having
identity the empty string.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>If <span class="math inline">M</span>
is a monoid and <span class="math inline">1&#39;\in M</span> satisfies
<span class="math inline">1&#39;m = m = m1&#39;</span> then <span
class="math inline">1&#39; = 1</span></em>.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: <span class="math inline">1&#39;1 = 1</span>. The
identiy element of a monoid is unique.</p>
<p>Examples of categories are <span
class="math inline">\mathbf{Set}</span> with objects sets and arrows
functions, <span class="math inline">\mathbf{Par}</span> with arrows
partial functions, and <span class="math inline">\mathbf{Rel}</span>
with arrows relations. Every partially ordered set is a category with
arrows <span class="math inline">a\to b</span> if and only if <span
class="math inline">a\le b</span> in the ordering. Transitivity defines
composition and reflexivity provides the identity arrows.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>If <span class="math inline">P</span>
is a poset then there exists at most one arrow <span
class="math inline">a\to b</span> for <span class="math inline">a,b\in
P</span></em>.</p>
<p>This proves the associative law.</p>
<p>Many subcategories of <span class="math inline">\mathbf{Set}</span>
are “sets with structure.” The category <span
class="math inline">\mathbf{Mon}</span> has objects monoids and arrows
are <em>homomorphisms</em>: functions that preserve the binary
operation.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show if <span
class="math inline">f\colon M\to N</span> is a monoid homomorphism then
<span class="math inline">f(1_M) = 1_N</span></em>.</p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">1_M</span> and <span
class="math inline">1_N</span> are the identity elements of <span
class="math inline">M</span> and <span class="math inline">N</span>, not
the identity arrows.</p>
<p>The <em>forgetful functor</em> can be defined from any set with
structure</p>
<p>F:Set -&gt; Mon, G:Mon -&gt; Set, adjunction, monad example</p>
<p>The binary operation for a category is associative, when defined, but
identity arrows are all distinct.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I first stumbled across Category Theory as a fledgling assistant math
professor working in the area of operator theory and functional
analysis. Somehow I manage to land a job at an Ivy League school and had
the priveldge of working with people I idolized as a grad student.
Category theory seemed to unify things across different areas of
mathematics but my esteemed colleagues told me stop “wasting” my time on
that. They were quite adamant about how “useless” it was. That is when I
learned the phrase, “Every proof in category theory is either a ‘put
on’, or it’s dual, a ‘push over’”.</p>
<p>I’m not very good at listening to what other people tell me to do, so
I kept spending time trying to understand category theory. Many years
later I, um, inherited Sammy Eilenberg’s library of math books. (Don’t
ask, my wife would kill me.) He wrote notes in the margin. Not like
Fermat about what he wanted to prove, notes that were his unbowdlerized
comments about what the author was, or more often wasn’t, contributing
to the theory he and Saunder’s Mac Lane founded.</p>

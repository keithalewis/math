<p>A derivative security is a contract. A buyer pays a seller to make
payments on specified future dates. The seller quotes a price to the
buyer and is obligated make future payments if the contract is
executed.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize winning theory of Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and
Robert Merton III demonstrated how to dynamically replicate payoffs that
were a function of some underlying instrument price. The value of the
option is the cost of setting up the initial replicating hedge. They
showed the value of the initial hedge can be computed by taking the
risk-neutral expectation of discounted future payoffs and that the
initial hedge in the underlying is the derivative of the value with
respect to the underlying price, delta.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a trader and your boss asks for a quote on a European
call option. The B-S/M option value is <span class="math display">
    v = s N(d_1) - ke^{-\rho t}N(d_2),
</span> where <span class="math inline">s</span> is the current stock
price, <span class="math inline">k</span> is the call option strike,
<span class="math inline">\rho</span> is the risk-free rate, <span
class="math inline">t</span> is the time in years to expiration$, <span
class="math inline">N</span> is the standard normal cumulative
distribution function, <span class="math inline">{d_1 = (\log s/k + \rho
t + \sigma^2t/2)/\sigma\sqrt{t}}</span>, and <span
class="math inline">{d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{t}}</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\sigma</span> is the volatility. To turn this
equation into a number that you can show to your boss you need to know
the current “price”, the strike, the “risk-free” rate, the “time in
years” to expiration, and the “volatility.”</p>
<p>The quoted words are not well defined. The strike and expiration are
defined in the call contract, but if the time to expiration is 3 months
how do you convert that into a time in years? What is the price of a
stock that rarely trades? What is the risk-free rate if you are a day
trader using your credit card for financing? Finally, if the underlying
has no listed options how do you devine the volatility? We know from
market data that a single volatility cannot be used to price options at
all strikes.</p>
<p>Suppose your boss agrees with the quote you provided and the buyer
executes the trade. Now you have to satisfy the contract obligation by
coming up with <span class="math inline">\max\{S_t - k, 0\}</span> at
expiration <span class="math inline">t</span>. The B-S/M theory suggests
you put on an initial delta hedge by purchasing <span
class="math display">
    \partial v/\partial s = N(d_1)
</span> shares of the stock. Note <span class="math inline">d_1</span>
and <span class="math inline">d_2</span> depend on <span
class="math inline">s</span> so this is non-trivial to prove.</p>
<p>Time moves on and the stock price changes. When do you change your
hedge, and by how much? The B-S/M theory answer is that you hedge
continuously, but that is untenable. It is a mathematical artifact of
using Ito processes to model prices and hedges. Every hedge involves
only a finite number of trades.</p>
<p>It long past time to stop whistling past the graveyard and confront
the realities of trading head on. The Unified Model puts your nose
directly into the most important ongoing problem of mathematical
finance: how do you value, hedge, and manage the risk of derivatives
using only a finite number of trades? It does not provide a solution to
this, only a simple and mathematically rigorous framework for studying
the problem based on Stephen Ross’<span class="citation"
data-cites="Ros1978">(Ross 1978)</span> “A Simple Approach to the
Valuation of Risky Streams”. According to Ross</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If there are no arbitrage opportunities in the capital markets,
then there exists a (not generally unique) valuation operator, <span
class="math inline">L</span></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He used the Hahn-Banach theorem to show the existence of <span
class="math inline">L</span> and observed it is not unique if the market
is not complete. We extend the theory to any portfolio of instruments
and define <span class="math inline">L</span> in terms of
<em>deflators</em>: positive measures indexed by time that depend only
on available information. His crucial insight was to show the absence of
arbitrage was purely geometric. Positive measures having mass one make a
showing, but their “risk-neutral probability” does not shed any light on
real-world probability.</p>
<p>The Unified Model does not require the Hahn-Banach theorem, much less
Ito processes or partial differential equations. Instruments have prices
and cash flows associated with holding them. Every arbitrage-free model
is determined by a martingale measure and a deflator. Multiple market
instruments can be used for hedging, not just one underlying. The
Unified Model generalizes the B-S/M delta hedge as a Frechet derivative
of the hedge value with respect to the vector of instruments used in the
hedge. The model allows for futures, options, and limit orders to be
used as hedging instruments.</p>
<p>Matt Levin likes to say “Everything is securities fraud.” My mantra
is “Everything is a derivative.” Just like a derivative, managing a
portfolio consists of a finite sequence of trades. The various XVA
calculations can be understood as a type of hedge. We are both wrong,
but hopefully in a useful way that piques your interest to read
furthur.</p>
<section id="motivation" class="level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>How do you give a quote on a European call option if you will get put
on the hook to satisfy the contract payout? Derivative contracts
probably existed before recorded history. Caveman Buyk may have agreed
to give caveman Selv 10 arrowheads today to get 1 bear skin by the next
full moon.</p>
<p>We still face the same problems as Buyk and Selv. Buyk wants a bear
skin and Selv has to figure out how to supply that. Is he a good enough
shot to need only 9 arrowheads, or will his arch nemisis Ubs undercut
him with an offer of 8 arrowheads? Buyk also has to consider who to
trust on delivering the bear skin at the next full moon.</p>
<p>Consider a derivative contract that pays the value of a stock at a
given expiration time. Obviously, the value of that contract is the
current stock price. Buy one share today and sell it at expiration to
satisfy the obligation.</p>

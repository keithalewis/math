<p>Hi Ramasastry,</p>
<p>My resume is https://kalx.net/resume.html in case Lester hasn’t
forwarded it.</p>
<p>He told me the immediate need is an API for what Jerome has
developed.</p>
<p>Below are my unexpugated thoughts. Please correct my
misunderstandings.</p>
<p>I’ve worked at Bloomberg as a Senior Software Engineer in their
Enterprise Business and at CrossX as CTO with Andy. To sell your product
you have to adapt it to potential customers. No Big Bank is going to
write a check for an API. You have to build trust with the decision
makers writing checks and have them tell their technology group to make
it happen.</p>
<p>If you can get clients, I can be your New York presence that helps
you integrate your software into their production systems.</p>
<p>Best, Keith</p>

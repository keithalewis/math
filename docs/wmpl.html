<p>Every trader knows about slippage. The price quoted by an exchange is
not necessarily the price at which a trade is executed. Market orders
get matched against limit orders like blocks dropping in tetris. Limit
order quantities get eaten up until the market order is filled. If the
market order is larger then the amount of the total of the level 1 limit
orders it spills over to the next best offers by the liquidity provider.
It is also possible other market orders or limit orders are placed in
the meantime.</p>
<p>If you have spent time on a trading floor you have probably heard a
discussion between a trader and a back office person about how their
positions were marked-to-market. Traders care about this very much
because that is used to determine their profit and loss, but they
sometimes don’t understand exactly how this is calculated.</p>
<p>This document provides a precise description of how P&amp;L is
calculated.</p>
<p>The atoms of finance are <em>positions</em>: a legal entity owns some
amount of an instrument. Positions change via <em>transactions</em>:
amounts and instruments are exchanged at some time between two entities.
A <em>portfolio</em> is a collection of positions belonging to an
entity. A <em>market</em> is a collection of portfolios.</p>
<p>We can express this using math by a position is an amount,
instrument, and entity: <span class="math inline">\pi = (a, i, e)</span>
and a transaction is the exchange of positions at some time <span
class="math inline">t</span>: <span class="math inline">\chi = (t, \pi,
\pi&#39;)</span>. The market <span class="math inline">{\{\ldots,(a, i,
e),\ldots,(a&#39;,i&#39;,e&#39;),\ldots\}}</span> becomes <span
class="math inline">{\{\ldots,(a&#39;, i&#39;,
e),\ldots,(a,i,e&#39;),\ldots\}}</span> after the transaction.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\mathcal{M} = \{\pi_j\}</span> is a
market define the <em>net</em> amount of instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span> held by entity <span
class="math inline">e</span> by <span class="math display">
    N(i, e) = \sum_{\pi_j = (a_j, i_j, e_j)}\{a_j\mid i_j = i, e_j =
e\}.
</span></p>
<p>The <em>market price</em> of a transaction <span
class="math inline">\chi = (t,\pi,\pi&#39;)</span> is <span
class="math inline">X^{i&#39;}_{i} = a&#39;/a</span>. To calculate
P&amp;L in native currency <span class="math inline">i_0</span> it is
necessary to specify “prices” <span
class="math inline">X^{i_0}_{i}</span> for each instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span>. The position <span
class="math inline">(a,i,e)</span> can, in principal, be exchanged for
<span class="math inline">(aX^{i_0}_i, i_0, e_0)</span> with some
imaginary entity <span class="math inline">e_0</span>. The
<em>mark-to-market</em> in currency <span class="math inline">i_0</span>
for entity <span class="math inline">e</span> is <span
class="math display">
    N(e) = \sum_{\pi_j = (a_j, i_j, e_j)}\{a_jX^{i_0}_{i_j}\mid e_j =
e\}.
</span> The <em>profit-and-loss</em> over an interval of time is the
difference of the mark-to-mark at the end and beginning of the
interval.</p>
<p>It is not controversial to assume <span
class="math inline">X^{i_0}_{i_0} = 1</span> but the other “prices” can
be contentious. If <span class="math inline">i</span> is exchange traded
and liquid then its closing price can be used. If <span
class="math inline">i</span> is rarely traded then its price is
problematic to determine. Firms often have pricing models for illiquid
instruments that everyone agrees to use in order to prevent heated
arguments.</p>

<h2>But that’s not all!</h2>
<p>If you work in a back office you have to deal with fiddly, but
important, details. It is not as simple as specifying a position as an
amount, instrument, and entity. The amount can be precisely modeled as
an integer. Every instrument has a lowest level of divisibility and
trades in an integer multiple of that.</p>
<p>Instruments have <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Securities_Identification_Number">ISIN</a>s
that are supposed to uniquely identify them. If you can afford to pay
for them.</p>
<p>There are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Entity_Identifier">LEI</a>s to
identify legal entities, but legal entities have internal subdivisions.
The back office has to keep track of the ever changing portfolio
managers.</p>
<p>We have to give names to mathematical concepts, but I always think in
terms of the mathematical concepts. The names are just shorthand. The
fundamental problem of risk management is assessing the risk of future
P&amp;L, where P&amp;L is a stochastic process defined by a model.</p>
<p>In the one-period case the model is a set <span
class="math inline">I</span> of instruments, initial prices <span
class="math inline">x \in \RR^I</span>, a set <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span> of possible outcomes over the period,
a function <span class="math inline">X\colon\Omega \to \RR^I</span> of
final prices given <span class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span>
occurred, and a probability measure <span class="math inline">P</span>
on Omega. P&amp;L is defined by specifying a portfolio <span
class="math inline">\xi\in\RR^I</span>. To be completely rigorous, <span
class="math inline">\xi</span> is in the dual space of <span
class="math inline">\RR^I</span> with dual pairing <span
class="math inline">xi^* x = \langle x, xi\rangle = sum_{i\in I} xi_i
x_i</span>. In this case the stochastic process for the P&amp;L is the
number <span class="math inline">xi^* x</span> at time 0 and the random
variable <span class="math inline">xi^*X\colon\Omega \to \RR</span> at
time 1. What is the “risk” of the one period model P&amp;L? </p>

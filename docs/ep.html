CAPM holds as equality of random variables, not just their expected
value.

</header>
<p>Given two random realized returns on an investment, which is to be
preferred? This is a fundamental problem in finance that has no
definitive solution except in the case one investment always returns
more than the other. In 1952 Markowitz<span class="citation"
data-cites="Mar52">[@Mar52]</span> and Roy<span class="citation"
data-cites="Roy52">[@Roy52]</span> introduced the following criterion
for risk vs. return in portfolio selection: if two portfolios have the
same expected realized return then prefer the one with smaller variance.
An <em>efficient portfolio</em> has the least variance among all
portfolios having the same expected realized return.</p>
<p>In the one-period model every efficient portfolio belongs to a
two-dimensional subspace and is uniquely determined given its expected
realized return. We show that if <span class="math inline">R</span> is
the realized return of any efficient portfolio and <span
class="math inline">R_0</span> and <span class="math inline">R_1</span>
are the realized returns of any two linearly independent efficient
portfolios then <span class="math display">
    R - R_0 = \beta(R_1 - R_0)
</span> where <span class="math inline">\beta = \operatorname{Cov}(R -
R_0, R_1 - R_0)/\operatorname{Var}(R_1 - R_0)</span>. This generalizes
the classical Capital Asset Pricing Model formula for the expected
realized return of efficient portfolios. Taking expected values of both
sides when <span class="math inline">\operatorname{Var}(R_0) = 0</span>
and <span class="math inline">R_1</span> is the “market” portfolio gives
the classic CAPM formula <span class="math display">
    E[R] - R_0 = \beta(E[R_1] - R_0)
</span> where <span class="math inline">\beta = \operatorname{Cov}(R,
R_1)/\operatorname{Var}(R_1)</span>.</p>
<p>The primary contribution of this short note is the observation that
the CAPM formula holds for realized returns as random variables, not
just their expectations. This follows directly from writing down a
mathematical model for one period investments.</p>

## Background

After the US stock market crash of 1929 the government passed the 1933
Glass-Steagall Act prohibited banks from participating in the stock
market and insurance industry. In 1934 the Securities
and Exchange Commission was established to protect retail investors from market
manipulation by large banks.

In the same year, Benjamin Graham and David Todd, professors at Columbia Business
School at the time, published _Security Analysis_. Their premise was
to value a business based on their current balance sheet and expected future cash flows.

Markowitz was the Marcel Duchamp of portfolio management.  Instead of due
diligence on individual companies he showed how portfolio managers could
use the collective wisdom of publicly available market prices. Market
data and compute power was limited at the time so returns and covariances were based
on daily data.

<h2>One-Period Model</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">I</span> be the set of <em>market
instruments</em> and <span class="math inline">\Omega</span> be the set
of possible market outcomes over the period. The <em>one-period
model</em> specifies the initial instrument prices <span
class="math inline">x\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and
the final instrument prices <span
class="math inline">X\colon\Omega\to\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> depending on
the outcome <span class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span> that
occurs. The one period model also specifies a probability measure <span
class="math inline">P</span> on the space of outcomes.</p>
<p>A <em>portfolio</em> <span
class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> is the number of
shares initially purchased in each instrument. It costs <span
class="math inline">{\xi^T x = \sum_{i\in I} \xi_i x_i}</span> to
acquire the portfolio at the beginning of the period and returns <span
class="math inline">\xi^T X(\omega)</span> when liquidated at the end of
the period if <span class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span>
occurs.</p>
<p>The <em>realized return</em> of <span class="math inline">\xi</span>
is <span class="math inline">R_\xi = \xi^T X/\xi^T x</span> when <span
class="math inline">\xi^T x \not= 0</span>.</p>
<p>Note <span class="math inline">R_\xi = R_{t\xi}</span> for any
non-zero <span class="math inline">t\in\boldsymbol{R}</span> so there is
no loss in assuming <span class="math inline">\xi^T x = 1</span>. In
this case <span class="math inline">R_\xi = \xi^T X</span> is the
realized return of the portfolio. It is common to use <em>returns</em>
instead of realized returns where the return <span
class="math inline">r</span> is defined by <span class="math inline">R =
1 + r\Delta t</span> or <span class="math inline">R = \exp(r\Delta
t)</span> where <span class="math inline">\Delta t</span> is the time in
years or a day count fraction for the period. Since we are considering a
one period model there is no need to drag <span
class="math inline">\Delta t</span> into consideration.</p>

<h2>Efficient Portfolio</h2>
<p>A portfolio <span class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span>
is <em>efficient</em> if <span
class="math inline">\operatorname{Var}(R_\xi) \le
\operatorname{Var}(R_\eta)</span> for every portfolio <span
class="math inline">\eta</span> having the same expected realized return
as <span class="math inline">\xi</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\xi^T x = 1</span> then <span
class="math inline">\operatorname{Var}(R_\xi) = \xi^T V\xi</span>, where
<span class="math inline">{V = \operatorname{Var}(X) = E[XX^T] -
E[X]E[X^T]}</span>, and <span class="math inline">{R_\xi = \xi^T
E[X]}</span>. For a given expected realized return <span
class="math inline">R\in\boldsymbol{R}</span> we minimize <span
class="math display">
    \frac{1}{2}\xi^T V\xi - \lambda(\xi^T x - 1) - \mu(\xi^T E[X] - R)
</span> over <span class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span>,
<span class="math inline">\lambda\in\boldsymbol{R}</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\mu\in\boldsymbol{R}</span>. The <a
href="#appendix">Appendix</a> shows we may assume <span
class="math inline">V</span> is invertable and <span
class="math display">
        \xi =  \lambda V^{-1}x + \mu V^{-1} E[X] \\
</span> where <span class="math inline">\lambda = (C - R B)/D</span>,
<span class="math inline">\mu = (-B + R A)/D</span>, and <span
class="math inline">{A = x^T V^{-1}x}</span>, <span

class="math inline">{C = E[X^T]V^{-1}E[X]}</span>, where <span
class="math inline">{D = AC - B^2}</span>. Note that <span
class="math inline">A</span>, <span class="math inline">B</span>, <span
class="math inline">C</span>, and <span class="math inline">D</span>
depend only on <span class="math inline">x</span>, <span
class="math inline">E[X]</span>, and <span
class="math inline">E[XX^T]</span>. Classical literature focuses mainly
on the latter three which may explain why prior authors overlooked our
elementary but stronger result.</p>
<p>This shows every efficient porfolio is in the span of <span
class="math inline">V^{-1}x</span> and <span class="math inline">V^{-1}
E[X]</span>. If <span class="math inline">\xi_0</span> and <span
class="math inline">\xi_1</span> are any two independent efficient
portfolios then <span class="math inline">{\xi = \beta_0\xi_0 +
\beta_1\xi_1}</span> for some scalars <span
class="math inline">\beta_0</span> and <span
class="math inline">\beta_1</span>. Assuming <span
class="math inline">\xi_j^T x = 1</span> for <span class="math inline">j
= 0,1</span> then <span class="math inline">R_{\xi_j} = \xi_j^T
X</span>.</p>
<p>Assuming <span class="math inline">\xi^T x = 1</span> then <span
class="math inline">1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1</span> and <span
class="math inline">\xi^T X = \beta_0\xi_0^T X + \beta_1\xi_1^T X</span>
so <span class="math display">
    R_\xi - R_{\xi_0} = \beta(R_{\xi_1} - R_{\xi_0})
</span> as functions on <span class="math inline">\Omega</span>, where
<span class="math display">
    \beta = \operatorname{Cov}(R_\xi - R_{\xi_0}, R_{\xi_1} -
R_{\xi_0})/\operatorname{Var}(R_{\xi_1} - R_{\xi_0}).
</span> The classical CAPM formula follows from taking expected values
of both sides when <span class="math inline">\xi_1</span> is the “market
portfolio” and <span class="math inline">\xi_0</span> is a <em>riskless
portfolio</em>.</p>
<p>A portfolio <span class="math inline">\zeta</span> is
<em>riskless</em> if its realized return is constant. In this case <span
class="math inline">\operatorname{Var}(R_\zeta) = 0</span> so it is
efficient.</p>

<h2>Risk-neutral Measure</h2>

<p>If <span class="math inline">x</span> belongs to the smallest closed

<span class="math inline">x = \int_\Omega X dD</span> for some positive

class="math inline">\Omega</span>. If we define <span
class="math inline">P = D/D(\Omega)</span> then <span
class="math inline">P</span> is a positive measure with mass 1.</p>
<p>The one-period Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing states there is
no model arbitrage if and only if there exists a positive measure <span
class="math inline">\Pi</span> on <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span> with <span class="math inline">x =
\int_\Omega X(\omega)\,d\Pi(\omega)</span>. We assume <span
class="math inline">X</span> is bounded, as it is in the real world, and
<span class="math inline">\Pi</span> is finitely additive.</p>
<p>If such a measure exists and <span class="math inline">\xi^T
X\ge0</span> then <span class="math inline">\xi^T x = \int_\Omega \xi^T
X\,d\Pi \ge0</span> so arbitrage cannot occur. The other direction is
less trivial.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> <em>If <span
class="math inline">x\in\boldsymbol{R}^n</span> and <span
class="math inline">C</span> is a closed cone in <span

class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^n</span> with <span
class="math inline">\xi^T x &lt; 0</span> and <span
class="math inline">\xi^T y \ge0</span> for <span
class="math inline">y\in C</span>.</em></p>
<p>Recall that a <em>cone</em> is a subset of a vector space closed
under addition and multiplication by a positive scalar, that is, <span
class="math inline">C + C\subseteq C</span> and <span
class="math inline">tC\subseteq C</span> for <span class="math inline">t
&gt; 0</span>. The set of arbitrage portfolios is a cone.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Since <span class="math inline">C</span> is closed
and convex there exists <span class="math inline">x^*\in C</span> with
<span class="math inline">0 &lt; ||x^* - x|| \le ||y - x||</span> for
all <span class="math inline">y\in C</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\xi = x^* - x</span>. For any <span
class="math inline">y\in C</span> and <span class="math inline">t &gt;
0</span> we have <span class="math inline">ty + x^*\in C</span> so <span
class="math inline">||\xi|| \le ||ty + \xi||</span>. Simplifying gives
<span class="math inline">t^2||y||^2 + 2t\xi^T y\ge 0</span>. Dividing
by <span class="math inline">t &gt; 0</span> and letting <span
class="math inline">t</span> decrease to 0 shows <span
class="math inline">\xi^T y\ge 0</span>. Take <span
class="math inline">y = x^*</span> then <span class="math inline">tx^* +
x^*\in C</span> for <span class="math inline">t \ge -1</span>. By
similar reasoning, letting <span class="math inline">t</span> increase
to 0 shows <span class="math inline">\xi^T x^*\le 0</span> so <span
class="math inline">\xi^T x^* = 0</span>. Now <span
class="math inline">0 &lt; ||\xi||^2 = \xi^T (x^* - x) = -\xi^T x</span>
hence <span class="math inline">\xi^T x &lt; 0</span>. <span
class="math inline">\blacksquare</span></p>
<p>Since the set of non-negative finitely additive measures is a closed
cone and <span class="math inline">X\mapsto \int_\Omega X\,d\Pi</span>
is positive, linear, and continuous <span class="math inline">C =
\{\int_\Omega X\,d\Pi : \Pi\ge 0\}</span> is also a closed cone. The
contrapositive follows from the lemma.</p>
<p>The proof also shows how to find an arbitrage when one exists.</p>

Erdos. Hawaii.
Thought he played chess, turned out to be go.
Misspent youth playing chess for quarters in the ASU student union.
Worst talk ever. Stood in front of what he was writing and turned to tell a story that occured to him, still covering the board.

At the memorial I found out John was not a good housekeeper.
I worked with him at Brown and had been to his house on occasion, and
even to his cabin in Enfield when Christine was still with us.

Even before I came to Brown I found his papers to be perfectly orderly. He
would state assumptions and prove lemmas in the order required, and by
the time you got to the proof of his main result everything was perfectly clear.

That made a big impression on me as a fledgling mathematician.
When I started attending his Wednesday analysis seminars I was shocked when I
heard him asking dumb questions. They had to be dumb, I knew the answer!

After each talk he would buttonhole the person he invited and get a brain dump
of the key ideas behind their result. Mathematicians start with simple examples
and generalize to the largest set of axioms for which they hold. 
An observation about integers can turn into a theorem about Noetherian rings.

John taught me how to learn new things after you got a PhD. Be humble,
ask questions, and be genuinely interested in acquiring new knowledge.
His seminar participants were happy to share their hard-won knowledge with him.

I am no longer a practicing mathematician. People in the business world
don't care about math. They have 99 problems to solve every day and maybe 1
of those can benefit them from mathematical treatment.

but I endeavor to replicate the same claity when communicating mathematics to business people who
could not care less about math.

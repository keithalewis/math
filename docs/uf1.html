Unified Finance – holding, exchange, portfolios, trading

<p>The financial world is a big, messy affair. No mathematical theory or
software implementation can accurately model reality. The best a theory
can do is to identify features relevant to practitioners that can be
practically implemented on a computer.</p>
<section id="holding" class="level2">
<h2>Holding</h2>
<p>The atoms of finance are holdings. A <em>holding</em> is an
<em>amount</em>, an <em>instrument</em>, and an <em>entity</em>. We
write <span class="math inline">\alpha = (a, i, e)</span> to indicate
entity <span class="math inline">e</span> holds amount <span
class="math inline">a\in\bm{Z}</span> of instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span>. The amount is an integral multiple of the
minimum trading quantity of the instrument. Holdings are element of the
cartesian product <span class="math inline">A\times I\times E</span>
where <span class="math inline">A = \bm{Z}</span> is the set of
integers, <span class="math inline">I</span> is the set of market
instruments, and <span class="math inline">E</span> is the set of
entities. The set <span class="math inline">I</span> can be the set of
all instruments ever traded and <span class="math inline">E</span> can
be all past, current, and future possible entities. Math let’s you think
big.</p>
<section id="cash-flow" class="level3">
<h3>Cash Flow</h3>
<p>Holdings can entail <em>cash flows</em>. Stocks have dividends, bonds
have coupons, futures have daily margin adjustments. (Taxes?)</p>
</section>
<section id="position" class="level3">
<h3>Position</h3>
<p>A <em>position</em> is a (multi)set of holdings <span
class="math inline">\pi\subseteq A\times I\times E</span>. The total
amount of instrument <span class="math inline">i</span> held by entity
<span class="math inline">e</span> is <span class="math display">
    A(\pi, i, e) = \sum_{\alpha\in\pi}\{\alpha.a\mid \alpha.i = i,
\alpha.e = e\}
</span></p>
<p>This can be implemented as a <code>positions</code> table in a
database with columns <code>amount</code>, <code>instrument</code>, and
<code>entity</code>. The above calculation corresponds to the SQL
query</p>
<pre><code>    SELECT SUM(amount) AS A
    FROM positions
    WHERE instrument = i AND entity = e</code></pre>
</section>
</section>
<section id="exchange" class="level2">
<h2>Exchange</h2>
<p>An <em>exchange</em> occurs when two entities swap the amounts and
instruments of their holdings. Given holdings <span
class="math inline">{\alpha = (a, i, e)}</span> and <span
class="math inline">{\alpha&#39; = (a&#39;, i&#39;, e&#39;)}</span>
then, after the exchange settles, the entities hold <span
class="math inline">{(a&#39;, i&#39;, e)}</span> and <span
class="math inline">{(a, i, e&#39;)}</span> respectively.</p>
<section id="price" class="level3">
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>Often entity <span class="math inline">e</span> is a <em>buyer</em>
and entity <span class="math inline">e&#39;</span> is a <em>seller</em>.
A buyer decides whether or not to execute the exchange based on the
<em>price</em> offered by the seller. The <em>post facto price</em> of
the exchange is <span class="math inline">{X = a&#39;/a}</span>. A
seller quotes a <em>pre facto price</em> <span
class="math inline">X</span> for instrument <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span> in terms of a currency <span
class="math inline">i</span>. If the buyer wants to acquire <span
class="math inline">n</span> shares of <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span> they must give the seller <span
class="math inline">nX</span> units of currency <span
class="math inline">i</span>. If <span class="math inline">n</span> is
large, or negative, the seller will adjust their quoted price. They
might also adjust the price based on the buyer.</p>
<p><em>Financial exchanges</em> sign up liquidity providers to supply
limit orders. Each provider offers to buy or sell a fixed amount of some
instrument if there are any takers. Exchanges make money by charging a
fraction of the amount exchanged. They only care about the volume of
trades.</p>
<p>Exchange customers open an account by depositing a
<em>margin</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>order book</em> shows the total amounts available to buy or
sell at each price level. They do not make the identity of liquidity
providers available.</p>
<p>The “price” of a market order executed by a customer of the exchange
is determined by the existing limit orders. The amount of the market
order is matched against limit orders. If the amount of level one orders
are less than the amount of the market order than the trade is matched
against the next level.</p>
<p>We write <span class="math inline">{\chi = (t, \alpha,
\alpha&#39;)}</span> to indicate the exchange occurred at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="transaction" class="level3">
<h3>Transaction</h3>
<p>A <em>transaction</em> is a collection of related exchanges. A broker
might charge the buyer, the seller, or both for facilitating an
exchange. If an entity holds an instrument they get all associated cash
flows proportional to the amount held at the time of the cash flow.
These are related exchanges but usually between the buyer and the
instrument issuer.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="valuation" class="level2">
<h2>Valuation</h2>
<p>How much is a position worth? In order to determine that you must
find putative prices for instruments you hold in terms of the currency
used for reporting. Accountants might use “book,” “market,”
“liquidation,” or “going concern” values.</p>
<p>Mathematics is agnostic to that important problem. Given a base
instrument (the reporting currency) <span
class="math inline">i_0</span>, a <em>price</em> function <span
class="math inline">X\colon I\to\bm{R}</span> determines the value of
converting instrument <span class="math inline">i\in I</span> to <span
class="math inline">i_0</span>.</p>

<p>Unlike the equity world where the volatility of stocks drown out
dainty considerations of interests rates, the price dynamics of fixed
income instruments without default are completely determine by the
(model of) repo rates. The large notionals involved require careful
attention to technical details involving valuation versus settlement,
day count conventions, and payment date adjustments based on roll
conventions and holiday calendars.</p>
<p>Building a yield curve involves cash deposits for the short term,
forward rate agreements/futures for the medium term, and swaps for the
long term. The problem of finding a discount curve repricing market
instruments is highly underdetermined. The bootstrap method assumes
forward rates are piecewise constant to provide a unique solution where
successive forwards correspond to the instrument maturities. It is
popular to use splining methods to “smooth” the forward curve but those
introduce spurious mathematical noise into the actual market prices.</p>
<p>It is better to spline by adding synthetic market instruments. Adding
a synthetic 6 year swap with par coupon linearly interpolated from
market 5 and 7 year par coupons is easier to explain to a trader than an
artifact of a cubic Hermite tension spline.</p>
<p>Replacing LIBOR by SOFR is a significant cost to doing business.
Lawyers have to draft new contracts and accomodate existing contracts
that depend on deprecated LIBOR quotes. Quants must devise new models
that can be tuned to the latest market instruments. Technologists need
to implement these. Businesses have to allocate funds for this and
assess the impact on current and future positions using the new
models.</p>

<p>In spite of these disruptions, SOFR connects more closly with the
theory of mathematical finance that has been quite successful in the
fixed income world. Dollar denominated swap markets out to 4 years have
been quoted to a few basis point spreads since the late 90’s. There is a
clear trajectory in mathematical finance of developing models that more
accurately reflect the realities of trading. SOFR is the overnight
secured lending rate. This maps directly to the (model of) repo
rates.</p>
<p>LIBOR was always a proxy for unsecured lending. After 2008 swaps with
different floating rate payment frequency started trading at different
values. This led to a cottage industry of ad hoc models. Intoducing a
hazard rate and recovery seems to be a little known two parameter
solution to fitting these curves.</p>
<p>Something mathematical finance still needs to grapple with is the
fact SOFR is far more volitile than LIBOR. It can jump more than
bitcoin, as witnessed in September 2019.</p>

<p>As with any new deveopment, understanding its history and current
details</p>
<p>The New York Fed calculates the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR)
and Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR) from daily transaction data
reported under the authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System on the FR 2420 Report of Selected Money Market Rates.</p>

The Broad General Collateral Rate (BGCR) is a measure of rates on
overnight Treasury general collateral repurchase agreement (repo)
transactions. General collateral repo transactions are those for which
the specific securities provided as collateral are not identified until
after other terms of the trade are agreed. The BGCR includes all trades
in the Tri-Party General Collateral Rate plus GCF Repo transactions

The federal funds market consists of domestic unsecured borrowings in
U.S. dollars by depository institutions from other depository
institutions and certain other entities, primarily government-sponsored
enterprises.

The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) provides a broad measure of
the general cost of financing Treasury securities overnight. The SOFR
includes all trades used in the BGCR plus data on transactions cleared
through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s Delivery-versus-Payment
(DVP) repo service. In the DVP repo market, counterparties identify
specific securities to settle each trade, rather than a population of
acceptable collateral as in the tri-party repo market.

The Tri-Party General Collateral Rate (TGCR) is a measure of rates on
overnight, specific-counterparty tri-party general collateral repurchase
agreement (repo) transactions secured by Treasury securities. General
collateral repo transactions are those for which the specific securities
provided as collateral are not identified until after other terms of the
trade are agreed.

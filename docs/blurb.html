<p>There is a clear trajectory in mathematical finance starting from
Black, Scholes, and Merton’s Nobel Prize winning work demonstrating the
value of an option is the cost of setting up the initial hedge. Ross
showed how to extend this to any portfolio of instruments in a
one-period setting. Since then, more general option payoffs and
multi-period models were developed to extend theory to more closely
align with trading reality.</p>
<p>There are still some basic questions that existing theory cannot
answer. Perhaps these were obscured by mathematical artifacts due to
using a continuous time stochastic process to model stock prices.
Scholes and Merton won a Nobel prize for showing the initial hedge does
not involve the return on the underlying, only the rate used for funding
the dynamic hedge and the volatility of the underlying instrument.</p>
<p>The first question a trader has after putting on an initial hedge is
when, and how much, to adjust that as market prices move. Current theory
has no answer for that. A trader aphorism is “hedge when you can, not
when you have to.” They also know</p>

<p>There is a clear trajectory in mathematical finance starting from
Black, Scholes, and Merton’s Nobel Economic Prize winning work
demonstrating how to replicate an option payoff by delta hedging. The
value of the option is the cost of setting up the initial hedge. Their
Platonic Ideal of a bond, stock, and option with perfect liquidity and
trading in continuous time is evolved to any collection of instruments
and accurately model features relevant business needs.</p>
<p>Ross showed how to extend this to any portfolio of instruments and
should have won a Nobel Economic Prize for figuring out option valuation
does not require the complicated machinery of Ito processes and partial
differential equations.</p>
<p>Since then, more general option payoffs and multi-period models were
developed to extend theory to more closely align with trading
reality.</p>
<p>There are still some basic questions that existing theory cannot
answer. Perhaps these were obscured by mathematical artifacts due to
using a continuous time stochastic process to model stock prices.
Scholes and Merton won a Nobel prize for showing the initial hedge does
not involve the return on the underlying, only the rate used for funding
the dynamic hedge and the volatility of the underlying instrument.</p>
<p>The first question a trader has after putting on an initial hedge is
when, and how much, to adjust that as market prices move. Current theory
has no answer for that. A trader aphorism is “hedge when you can, not
when you have to.” They also know</p>

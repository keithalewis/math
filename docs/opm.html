The Capital Asset Pricing Model assumes that a probability measure is
specified on the sample space of possible outcomes.
[@Mar1952] and [@Roy1952] developed Modern
Portfolio Theory by introducing the concept of an efficient portfolio:
one for which no alternative portfolio offers a higher expected return
at the same level of risk, or a lower level of risk for the same expected
return. In their framework, risk is quantified using the variance of realized
returns.

A common parameterization is to assume returns are jointly normal.
This reduces parameter estimation to the mean and covariance matrix.
If we assume a multi period model where the returns are stationary and independent
(i.e., a random walk)
then standard linear regression can be used to estimate the parameters
based on historical prices. There are still some practical questions
to answer: How far back do you go? Do you use exponential weights?
What exponent should you use?

[@Ros1976] invented Arbitrage Pricing Theory as a systematic approach to estimate
a CAPM probability distribution that depends on information other than historical prices.

After reseachers noted empirical contradictions of the CAPM [@FamFre1992] introduced
specific factors. In addition to excess return over the risk-free rate they used the excess returns
of small‑cap stocks over large‑cap stocks (SMB) and the excess returns of value stocks
over growth stock (HML). They also assume stationary and independent returns
and use linear regression to estimate their model parameters.

If the sample space consists of two point we get the binomial model.
It is not at all realistic, but it can illustrate the concept of arbitrage.
Models that are not arbitrage free are useless so we need a way of
detecting the. The Fundamental Theorem of asset pricing for the one-period
model states there is no arbitrage if and only if the initial prices belong
so the smallest closed cone containing all possible final prices.

-->
<p>The One‑Period Model provides the simplest formal framework for
describing a financial market over a single period where trading is
allowed only at the start and end of the period. It specifies the prices
of available instruments at the start of the period and their prices and
cash flows at the end depending on what occurred. We make the usual
unrealistic assumptions that prices are real numbers instead of integral
multiples of each instrument’s minimum trading increment/tick size, and
there is no bid-ask spread depending on the amount being bought or sold,
much less any consideration of the credit rating of counterparties
involved. The <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> proposes a model that can
incorporate more realistic assumptions.</p>
<p>Quants turn math into software that traders use. If they roll out a
model that is not arbitrage-free then a “clever” trader will find an
“arbitrage” and any business that didn’t have risk controls in place to
prevent this will most likely lose money.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing identifies arbitrage-free
models and provides an arbitrage if they are not. As <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ros1978">(Ross 1978)</span> showed, this is
a purely geometric result having nothing to do with probability.
Positive measures with mass one make an appearance, but they are not the
probability of anything.</p>
<section id="one-period-model" class="level2">
<h2>One-Period Model</h2>
<p>The <em>One-Period Model</em> consists of a set or market
<em>instruments</em>, <span class="math inline">I</span>, available for
trading at the start and end of a period. The set of possible
<em>outcomes</em>, <span class="math inline">\Omega</span>, is what can
happen over the period. The <em>prices</em> at the beginning of the
period are a vector <span
class="math inline">x\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
The prices at the end of the period are a function <span
class="math inline">X\colon\Omega\to
\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> where <span
class="math inline">X(\omega)\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> are the
instrument prices if <span class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span>
occurred. Instruments can have associated cash flows such as bond
coupons or stock dividends. We use <span
class="math inline">C\colon\Omega\to\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> to denote
the cash flows paid at the end of the period.</p>
<section id="binomial-model" class="level3">
<h3>Binomial Model</h3>
<p>The <em>binomial model</em> (with no dividends) has a bond and stock
where <span class="math inline">x = (1, s)</span>, <span
class="math inline">X(\omega) = (R, \omega)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\Omega = \{L, H\}</span> with <span
class="math inline">{L &lt; H}</span>. The bond has realized return
<span class="math inline">R</span> and the stock can go from price <span
class="math inline">s</span> to either <span
class="math inline">L</span> or <span class="math inline">H</span>. A
somewhat more realistic model is <span class="math inline">{\Omega = [L,
H]}</span> where the final stock price can be any value in the
interval.</p>
<p>The bond could be a cash deposit or Treasury bill that has a cash
flow at the end of the period. These are typically quoted as a
<em>yield</em> having a <em>day count basis</em> that can be used to
calculate the realized return. T-bills use Actual/360 day count basis.
The quoted yield <span class="math inline">y</span> indicates the price
now of unit notional received in <span class="math inline">t</span> days
is <span class="math inline">1 - yt/360</span>. The realized return
<span class="math inline">R</span> is the reciprocal of this.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="arbitrage" class="level2">
<h2>Arbitrage</h2>
<p>A <em>position</em> <span
class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> is the number of
shares purchased in each instrument. The cost of acquiring the initial
position is <span class="math inline">\xi\cdot x</span>. The value of
liquidating the position at the end of the period is <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot(X(\omega) + C(\omega))}</span> if <span
class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span> occurred. The one-period
model implicitly assumes the position is liquidated and the prices and
cash flows are received at the end of the period.</p>
<p>In the one-period model the final price is usually assumed to include
the cash flow and under this assumption we use <span
class="math inline">X</span> instead of <span class="math inline">X +
C</span>. In multi-period models this distinction becomes crucial.</p>
<p><em>Arbitrage</em> exists in a one-period model if there is a
position <span class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> with
<span class="math inline">{\xi\cdot x &lt; 0}</span> and <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot X(\omega)\ge0}</span> for all <span
class="math inline">{\omega\in\Omega}</span>: you make money acquiring
the initial position and don’t lose money when unwinding it at the end
of the period.</p>
<p>Some authors define arbitrage as a portfolio with <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot x = 0}</span> and <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot X}</span> is non-negative and strictly
positive on some set having positive probability. We haven’t specified,
and don’t need, a probability measure so we can’t use this definition.
No trader would consider that to be an arbitrage anyway. Even though the
position costs nothing to put on, that definition has nothing definite
to say about how much they will make nor how likely it is they will make
it.</p>
<p>Even our stronger definition is still not good enough for traders and
risk managers. Even though <span class="math inline">\xi\cdot x</span>
is strictly negative they will consider how much capital will be tied up
putting on that position and compute the ratio <span
class="math inline">\xi\cdot x/|\xi|\cdot |x|</span>. If it is small
they will take a pass on that “arbitrage” opportunity. No business would
approve using a million dollars from their funding account to make at a
penny even though that satisfies the mathematical definition of
arbitrage.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>If <span class="math inline">Rs\notin
[L,H]</span> in the binomial model then there is an arbitrage</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: If <span class="math inline">Rs &gt; H</span> the bond
is always more valuable than the stock so short the stock and buy bond.
If <span class="math inline">Rs &lt; L</span> the bond is always less
valuable than the stock so short the bond and buy the stock.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Solution
</summary>
<p>If <span class="math inline">Rs &gt; H</span> take <span
class="math inline">\xi = (H, -R)</span> so <span
class="math inline">\xi\cdot x = H - Rs &lt; 0</span>, <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot X(L) = HR - RL &gt; 0}</span>, and <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot X(H) = HR - RH = 0}</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\xi\cdot X\ge0</span> on <span
class="math inline">\{L,H\}</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">Rs &lt; L</span> take <span
class="math inline">\xi = (-L, R)</span> so <span
class="math inline">\xi\cdot x = -L + Rs &lt; 0</span>, <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot X(L) = -LR + RL = 0}</span>, and <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot X(H) = -LR + RH &gt; 0}</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\xi\cdot X\ge0</span> on <span
class="math inline">\{L,H\}</span>.</p>
This argument also holds for the somewhat more realistic model with
<span class="math inline">\Omega = [L, H]</span>.

</details>
<p>The contrapositive is also true.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>. <em>Arbitrage exists in the one-period
model if <span class="math inline">x</span> does not belong to the
smallest closed cone containing the range of <span
class="math inline">X</span>. If <span class="math inline">x^*</span> is
the closest point in the cone then <span class="math inline">\xi = x^* -
x</span> is an arbitrage</em>.</p>
<p>In general, the arbitrage is not unique. We will establish the
theorem using the purely geometric</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>. <em>If <span
class="math inline">x\in\boldsymbol{R}^n</span> and <span
class="math inline">C</span> is a closed cone in <span
class="math inline">\boldsymbol{R}^n</span> with <span
class="math inline">x\not\in C</span> then there exists <span
class="math inline">{\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^n}</span> with <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot x &lt; 0}</span> and <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot y \ge0}</span> for <span
class="math inline">{y\in C}</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Let <span class="math inline">x^*</span> be the point
in <span class="math inline">C</span> closest to <span
class="math inline">x</span>. It exists since <span
class="math inline">C</span> is closed and is unique since <span
class="math inline">C</span> is convex.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">ty + x^*\in C</span> for any <span
class="math inline">t &gt; 0</span> and <span class="math inline">y\in
C</span> we have <span class="math inline">\|x^* - x\| \le \|ty + x^* -
x\|</span>. Simplifying gives <span class="math inline">{t^2||y||^2 +
2t\xi\cdot y\ge0}</span>. Dividing by <span class="math inline">t &gt;
0</span> and letting <span class="math inline">t</span> decrease to 0
shows <span class="math inline">{\xi\cdot y\ge0}</span> for all <span
class="math inline">y\in C</span>.</p>
<p>We also have <span class="math inline">\|x^* - x\| \le \|(t + 1)x^* -
x\|</span> for <span class="math inline">t + 1 &gt; 0</span>.
Simplifying gives <span class="math inline">{t^2||x^*||^2 + 2t\xi\cdot
x^*\ge 0}</span> for <span class="math inline">t &gt; -1</span>.
Dividing by <span class="math inline">t &lt; 0</span> and letting <span
class="math inline">t</span> increase to 0 shows <span
class="math inline">{\xi\cdot x^*\le 0}</span> so <span
class="math inline">{0 &lt; ||\xi||^2 = \xi\cdot (x^* - x) \le -\xi\cdot
x}</span> hence <span class="math inline">{\xi\cdot x &lt;
0}</span>.</p>
<p>The lemma proves the FTAP and that <span class="math inline">\xi =
x^* - x</span> implements an arbitrage.</p>
<p>If we assume prices are bounded, as they are in the real world, then
every point in the closed convex cone generated by the range of <span
class="math inline">X</span> can be written <span
class="math inline">\int_\Omega X(\omega)\,dD(\omega)</span> for some
positive, bounded, finitely additive measure <span
class="math inline">D\in ba(\Omega)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span>, but this requires a bit more math to
establish. See <span class="citation" data-cites="DunSch1958">(Dunford
and Schwartz 1958)</span>. We call any such measure
<em>risk-neutral</em>. In general, risk-neutral measures are not
unique.</p>
<p>A <em>zero coupon bond</em> pays 1 unit at the end of the period on
every outcome. A portfolio <span
class="math inline">\zeta\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> with <span
class="math inline">{\zeta\cdot X(\omega) = 1}</span> for all <span
class="math inline">{\omega\in\Omega}</span> is a zero coupon bond. The
<em>price</em>, or <em>discount</em>, of a zero coupon bond is <span
class="math inline">{\zeta\cdot x = \int_\Omega \zeta\cdot
X(\omega)\,dD(\omega) = D(\Omega)}</span>. The measure <span
class="math inline">{D/D(\Omega)}</span> is positive and has mass 1 so
<span class="math inline">{x = E[X]D(\Omega)}</span> if we pretend it is
a probability measure.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>If <span
class="math inline">\zeta</span> is a zero coupon bond with only one
non-zero component then that component is equal to the
discount</em>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\xi\cdot X = 0</span> then one
instrument is a linear combination of the others and can be removed.
This can be repeated until <span class="math inline">\xi\cdot
X\not=0</span> for any <span
class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span>. If so the map <span
class="math inline">\xi\mapsto\xi\cdot X</span> is one-to-one. A model
is <em>complete</em> if this map is <em>onto</em>. This cannot be the
case if the cardinality of <span class="math inline">I</span> is less
than the cardinality of <span class="math inline">\Omega</span>. In
general the number of instruments is much smaller than the number of
outcomes. Although complete markets are common in mathematical finance
books, they almost never occur in models faithful to the real world.</p>
<section id="realized-return" class="level3">
<h3>Realized Return</h3>
<p>The <em>realized return</em> on a portfolio <span
class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span> is <span
class="math inline">{R_\xi = \xi\cdot X/\xi\cdot x}</span> whenever
<span class="math inline">{\xi\cdot x\not=0}</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show <span class="math inline">R_\xi =
R_{t\xi}</span> for any non-zero <span
class="math inline">t\in\boldsymbol{R}</span></em>.</p>
<p>This is actually a deleterious feature of the model. Going long or
short typically affects the realized return. It also implies a portfolio
stategy can be scaled to arbitrarily large positions. At some point you
will run out of instruments to buy and sell.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\xi\cdot x = 1</span> then <span
class="math inline">R_\xi = \xi\cdot X</span>. One unit invested at the
beginning of the period results in <span
class="math inline">{R_\xi\colon\Omega\to\boldsymbol{R}}</span> at the
end of the period. Every portfolio has the same expected realized return
under a risk-neutral measure so perhaps this should be called
<em>risk-blind</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>If <span class="math inline">D</span>
is a risk-neutral measure then <span class="math inline">R = E[R_\xi] =
1/D(\Omega)</span> is constant for any portfolio <span
class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{R}^I</span></em>.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: The expectation is with respect to the “probability”
measure <span class="math inline">DR = D/D(\Omega)</span>.</p>
<p>This shows <span class="math inline">\xi\cdot X = E[\xi\cdot X]
D(\Omega)</span> so <span class="math inline">E[R_\xi] = 1/D(\Omega) =

<h3>Grassmann Algebra</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">E</span> be the set of points in space.

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show <span class="math inline">P(Q +

<p>Congratulations! You have just proved the medians of a triangle
intersect its centroid. In Grassmann Algebra the centroid of a triangle
determined by points <span class="math inline">P</span>, <span
class="math inline">Q</span>, and <span class="math inline">R</span> is
<span class="math inline">(P + Q + R)/3</span>, the midpoint of <span
class="math inline">Q</span> and <span class="math inline">R</span> is
<span class="math inline">(Q + R)/2</span> and the median from <span
class="math inline">P</span> to the midpoint is <span
class="math inline">P(Q + R)/2</span>. Permuting <span
class="math inline">P</span>, <span class="math inline">Q</span>, and
<span class="math inline">R</span> shows all three medians meet at the
centroid. Grassmann used algebra instead of Euclid’s ruler and compass.
It was the greatest invention in mathematics after René Descartes
introduced coordinates to specify points in two and three dimensions.
Grassmann got rid of coordinates and used points in space directly. His
algebra works in any number of dimensions and predated Einstein in not
assuming an absolute origin of points in space. Vector spaces come along
for free as the difference of two points.</p>
<p>Descartes assumed an origin for his coordinate system. Given an
origin <span class="math inline">O\in E</span> and points <span
class="math inline">P_1,\ldots,P_n\in E</span> is is possible to write
any point in their span as <span class="math inline">P = (1 - \sum_j
t_j)O + \sum_j t_j P_j</span>, as we will see shortly. The Cartesian
coordinates of the <span class="math inline">P_j</span> relative to
origin <span class="math inline">O</span> are the tuple <span
class="math inline">(t_1,\ldots,t_n)</span>. Note the coefficient of
<span class="math inline">O</span> is determined by the tuple.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">PQ = tRS</span> for some scalar <span

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Consider a model with a bond having

<p>Grassmann algebra can also be used to detect and find an arbitrage
when it exists. If any of the coefficients are negative then arbitrage
exists. If only one coefficient is negative the arbitrage is

<p>We can also extend this to an arbitrary number of call options with
strikes between the low and high values for the underlying instrument.
The author implemented this for the option trading book at Banc of
America Securities. We found the only arbitrage opportunities were
negative price butterfly spreads at adjacent traded strikes, but the
bid/ask spread turned the price positive.</p>

<p>We can make the one-period model more realistic. The price of an
instrument must be an integral multiple of its minimal trading
increment, or <em>tick size</em>. Let <span

<span class="math inline">i\in I</span>. Initial prices <span
class="math inline">x\in\boldsymbol{Z}^I</span> correspond to actual
prices <span class="math inline">x(i)\epsilon(i)</span>. Likewise for
final prices <span
class="math inline">X\colon\Omega\to\boldsymbol{Z}^I</span>.</p>
<p>Price depends on the amount being bought or sold. The amount must be
an integral multiple of its minimum share size, or <em>lot size</em>.
Let <span class="math inline">\delta(i)</span> be the lot size of
instrument <span class="math inline">i\in I</span>. Amounts <span
class="math inline">\xi\in\boldsymbol{Z}^I</span> correspond to amounts
<span class="math inline">\xi(i)\delta(i)</span>. The bid and ask are a

class="math inline">x(\xi,i) = x_i + \operatorname{sgn}(\xi)\eta</span>
where <span class="math inline">x_i</span> is the mid price models a

<p>A more realistic model is <span class="math inline">x(\xi,i) = x_i +

### Grassmann Algebra

We can also solve this using Grassmann Algebra. If $E$ is Euclidean
space define $\GG(E)$ to be the (associative) algebra of points in $E$ with the
condition $PQ = 0$ if and only if $P = Q$ so $PP = 0$. Note $PQ = -QP$
since $(P + Q)(P + Q) = 0$. If $PQ = aRS$ for some scalar $a$ we
say $PQ$ is _congruent_ to $RS$ and write $a = \frac{PQ}{RS}$. If $R = aP + bQ$ then $RPQ = 0$.
Furthermore $PR = bPQ$ and $RQ = aPQ$ so
$R = \frac{RQ}{PQ} P + \frac{PR}{PQ} Q$.

This generalizes to any number of dimensions. If $P_0\cdots P_k = aQ_0\cdots Q_k$
then $a = \frac{P_0\cdots P_k}{Q_0\cdots Q_k}$ and if $PP_0\cdots P_k = 0$ then
$$
    P = \sum_{j=0}^k \frac{P_0\cdots P\cdots P_k}{P_0\cdots P_k} P_j
$$
if $P_0\cdots P_k\not=0$ where $P$ in the numerator takes the $j$-th spot.
Note if $\sum_{j=0}^k a_j P_j = 0$ then $a_j = 0$ for $0\le j\le k$
and we say the $P_j$ are _linearly independent_.
Note the sum of the coefficients is 1 and $P$ is in the convex hull
of $P_0,\ldots,P_n$ if and only if all coefficients are non-negative.

The _weight_ of $aP + bQ$ is $a + b$. Every point having weight 1 on the line determined
by the points $P$ and $Q$ has the form ${R(t) = (1 - t)P + tQ = P + t(Q - P)}$.
Note $Q - P\not= R(t)$ for any $t$. As $t$ goes to infinity $(1 - t)/t$ goes to $-1$
and we interpret $R(\infty) = Q - P$ as the point at infinity determined by $P$ and $Q$
and call it the _vector_ from $P$ to $Q$. As $t$ goes to negative infinity
we get $R(-\infty) = P - Q = -R(\infty)$.

In the last problem above using only the stock and option,
let $O = (0,0)$ be the origin, $P_1 = (0,1)$, and $P_2 = (1,0)$.
We call $E_1 = P_1 - O$ the _stock dimension and $E_2 = P_2 - O$ the _option dimension.
Note
${X(90) = (90, 0) = O + 90E_1 + E_2}$,
${X(100) = (100, 0) = O + 100E_1 + E_2}$, and
${X(110) = (110, 1) = O + 110E_1 + E_2}$.
Since $OX(90)X(100) = 0$ we know $X(100)$ is a linear combination of $O$ and $X(90)$

The smallest cone containing the range of $X$ is the set of all linear
combinations of $X(\omega) - O$, $\omega\in\{90,100,110\}$, with non-negative
coefficients. Since $X(90) - O = .9(X(100) - O)$ we need only
consider $\omega\in\{90,110\}$ so the cone is
$$
\{O + t_{90} 90 E_1 + t_{100} 100 E_1 + t_{110}(110E_1 + 10E_2)\mid t_{90},t_{100},t_{110}\ge 0\}
$$
This is clearly the same a $\{O + tE_1 + u(11E_1 + E_2)\mid t,u\ge0\}$.
Note $x = O + 100E_1 + vE_2$ if the initial option price is $v$
and $v = \frac{OE_1x}{OE_1E_2}$.

By Grassmann Algebra, $t = \frac{Ox(11E_1+E_1)}{OE_1(11E_1 + E_2)}$
and $u = \frac{OE_1x}{OE_1(11E_1 + E_2)}$.
Since $Ox(11E_1+E_1)
= O(O + 100E_1 + vE_2)(11E_1+E_2)
= 100 OE_1E_2 + 11v OE_2E_1 = (100 - 11v) OE_1E_2$ we have $t = 100 - 11v$.
Since $O E_1 x = O E_1 (O + 100E_1 + vE_2) = v O E_1 E_2$
we have $u = v$ so $x$ is in the cone if and only
if $100 - 11v \ge0$ and $v\ge0$ hence $0\le v\le 100/11$.

A more interesting example is the case of options at multiple strikes.
By put-call parity we can assume they are all calls. The sample space is
$\Omega = [L, H]$ containing all strikes and $\omega\in\Omega$ is the final stock price.
The initial prices are $x = (1, s, v_1,\ldots,v_n)$
and the final prices are $X(\omega) = (R, \omega, (\omega - K_1)^+,\ldots,(\omega - K_n)^+)$
The range of $X$ is $\{X(\omega)\mid L\le \omega\le H\}$.
The smallest cone containing the range of $X$ is
$$
    \{tX(L) + uX(H) \sum_{j=1}^n t_n X(K_j)\mid t,u,t_j\ge0\}
$$
where $L < K_1 < \cdots < K_n < H$. If $E_0 = P_0 - O$ is the bond dimension

## Reality

If you are willing to assume prices are bounded, as they are in the real world, then
the one-period model should require $X\colon\Omega\to\RR^I$ is bounded.
This is not the case in the Black-Scholes/Merton continuous time model of lognormal stock prices.
Scholes and Merton won a Nobel prize "for a new method to determine the value of derivatives."
Their assumptions eliminated the need to measure the real-world return on a stock. 
There is still a Nobel prize to be won by someone who can come up with a generally accepted
way to determine the volatility of a stock.
And perhaps multiple future prizes for those who develop theories
not founded on the mathematical fictions of continuous time trading and unbounded prices.


## Hedging

Let $\nu\colon\RR^I\to\RR$ be the _payoff_ of a derivative instrument.
If there exists $\gamma\in\RR^I$ with $\nu(X) = \gamma\cdot X$ then
$E[\nu(X)/R] = \gamma\cdot x$
so the cost of setting up the perfect hedge is $E[\nu(X)/R]$.

We can always compute $\gamma = (d/dx)E[\nu(X)/R]$ and the above shows
$E[\nu(X)/R] = \gamma\cdot X$.
The variance $\Var(\nu(X) - \gamma\cdot X)$ is a measure of how
good the hedge is.




## Probability

We now assume there is a probability measure $P$ on $\Omega$ representing
the real-world event probabilities.

Let $U\colon B(\Omega)\to\RR$ be a _utility function_.
A common choice is $U(Y) = E[Y] - \alpha \Var(Y)$ for some positive risk parameter $\alpha\in\RR$.
Note if $Y\in B(\Omega)$ then moments of all orders exist.

To find a portfolio that maximizes the utility of the realized return we use Lagrange multipliers
to solve
$$
    \max_\xi U(\xi\cdot X) - \lambda(\xi\cdot x - 1).
$$

We need to compute the [Fréchet Derivatives](fd.html) of $D(UM_X)$ where $M_X\xi = \xi\cdot X$ is
the market map as above. The chain rule gives $D(UM_X)\xi = DU(M_x\xi)DM_X\xi = DU(M_x\xi)M_X\xi$
since $DM_X = M_X$.
Note $DU(M_x\xi)$ is in $B(\Omega)^*$ and $M_X\xi\in B(\Omega)$.

The first order condition is $0 = DU(\xi\cdot X)M_X\xi - \lambda x^*$ for all $\xi\in\RR^I$.

$\Var(\xi^T X - \nu(X)) = \xi^T\Var(X)\xi - 2\Cov(X^T, \nu(X))\xi + \Var(\nu(X))$.

$\|A\xi - b\|^2 = \xi^T A^TA \xi - 2b^TA\xi + \|b\|^2$

$\Var(X) = \Cov(X,X) = A^T A$. $\Cov(X^T, \nu(X)) = E[X^T,\nu(X)] = E[X]^TE[\nu(X)]$.

## Liquidity and Risk

It is possible to define a model that takes into account bid/ask spreads involving
the amount traded and the counterparties involved.
A _holding_ is a triple $(a,i,e)$ specifying an integer amount, instrument, and legal entity.
It indicates $e$ is the legal owner of amount $a$ of instrument $i$.
The amount is an integral number of (minimum fractional) shares of the instrument.

## Maximum Entropy

The _entropy_ of a measure on a finite set $Ω = \{ω_j\}$ with $P(\{ω_j\}) = p_j$, $p_j \ge0$,
is $H = -\sum_j p_j \log p_j$.

$Φ = -\sum_j p_j \log p_j - λ(\sum_j p_j - 1) - μ'(E[X] - Rx)$

$\partial Φ/\partial p_j = -1 - \log p_j - λp_j - μ_j X(ω_j)$

$\partial Φ/\partial λ = \sum_j p_j - 1$

$\partial Φ/\partial μ = E[X] - Rx$

$p_j = \exp(-1 - λ(\sum_j p_j - 1) - μ'(E[X] - Rx))$

$1 = \sum_j p_j = \sum_j \exp(-1 - λ(\sum_j p_j - 1) - μ'(E[X] - Rx))$

$Rx = E[X] = \sum_j X(ω_j) \exp(-1 - λ(\sum_j p_j - 1) - μ'(E[X] - Rx))$

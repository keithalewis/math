<p>There is a unified way to describe the foundations of the financial world. A <em>holding</em> is a triple of instrument, amount, and legal entity. A financial <em>transaction</em> consists of the exchange of two holdings at a given time.</p>
<h2 id="holding">Holding</h2>
<p>Finance involves <em>holding</em> <em>instruments</em>, <em>amounts</em>, and <em>legal entities</em>. Examples of instruments are: stocks, bonds, futures, currencies, commodities, etc. They are held by entities in some amount: shares, notional, contracts, units, and physical quantity respectively. We use lowercase Greek iota holdings; <span class="math inline">\iota = (i,a,e)</span> where <span class="math inline">i</span> is an instrument, <span class="math inline">a</span> is an amount, and <span class="math inline">e</span> is the legal entity owning the amount of the instrument.</p>
<h2 id="transaction">Transaction</h2>
<p>A <em>transaction</em> between two entities at a given time is a swap of entities between two holdings; <span class="math inline">\chi = (t;i,a,e;i&#39;,a&#39;,e&#39;)</span>. The first entity <span class="math inline">e</span> is the <em>buyer</em> and the second entity <span class="math inline">e&#39;</span> is the <em>seller</em>. The <em>price</em> of the exchange is <span class="math inline">X = a&#39;/a</span> and is determined by the seller. The buyer decides when to make an exchange based on the seller’s price (among other consideration).</p>
<p>For example, if the buyer <span class="math inline">b</span> holds 16 dollars <span class="math inline">(\$, 16, b)</span> and the seller <span class="math inline">s</span> has two shares of Ford stock <span class="math inline">(F, 2, s)</span> then the buyer can obtain two shares at price 8 dollars per share to get <span class="math inline">(2, F, b)</span> by giving the buyer <span class="math inline">(\$, 16, s)</span>.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange is not a special case. If the USD/JPY exhange rate is 100 then <span class="math inline">(\$, a)</span> can be exchanged for <span class="math inline">(</span>¥<span class="math inline">,100a)</span>. If we write $1 = ¥100 then USD/JPY is 100 where ‘1 =’ turns into ‘<span class="math inline">/</span>’.</p>
<p>Similarly, commodities are also not special. This model unifies trading of all instruments.</p>
<h2 id="market">Market</h2>
<p>The <em>market</em> <span class="math inline">\mathcal{M}_t</span> is the collection of holdings at time <span class="math inline">t</span>. A transaction <span class="math inline">\chi = (t;i,a,e;i&#39;,a&#39;,e&#39;)</span> changes the holdings <span class="math inline">\mathcal{M}_t</span> by replacing <span class="math inline">(i,a,e)</span> and <span class="math inline">(i&#39;,a&#39;,e&#39;)</span> with <span class="math inline">(i&#39;,a&#39;,e)</span> and <span class="math inline">(i,a,e&#39;)</span> respectively.</p>
<p>The market is determined by a sequence of transactons over time.</p>
<h2 id="price">Price</h2>
<p>Sellers determine prices. At any given time <span class="math inline">t</span> they quote a price for exchanging instruments with buyers given the amount the buyer wishes to obtain.</p>
<p>Price is a function <span class="math inline">X_t\colon I\times A\times E\times I\times E\to\bm{R}</span>, where <span class="math inline">I</span> is the set of instruments, <span class="math inline">A</span> is the set of amounts (which typically depends on <span class="math inline">i\in I</span>), and <span class="math inline">E</span> is the set of entities. At time <span class="math inline">t</span> the transaction <span class="math inline">(t;a,i,e;a X_t(i,a,e,i&#39;,e&#39;),i&#39;,e&#39;)</span> is available to the buyer <span class="math inline">e</span> from the seller <span class="math inline">e&#39;</span>. The amount <span class="math inline">a</span> is actually constrained by the instrument <span class="math inline">i</span> and possibly also by the time <span class="math inline">t</span> and seller <span class="math inline">e&#39;</span>. Instruments trade in finite increments (that can change over time) and sometimes cannot be shorted (<span class="math inline">a &lt; 0</span>). The amount available is also at the discretion of the seller and may consist of the empty set for some buyers.</p>
<p>Most models of price in the financial liturature do not depend on <span class="math inline">a</span>, <span class="math inline">e</span>, and <span class="math inline">e&#39;</span>. It is also common to assume <span class="math inline">i</span> is the native currency of the buyer <span class="math inline">e</span>. In this case <span class="math inline">X_t = X_t(i&#39;)</span> where <span class="math inline">i&#39;</span> is the instrument whos price is being modeled. Anyone who has traded knows there are different prices depending on whether you are buying or selling – the ask and the bid, respectively. Anyone who has traded large amounts also knows the bid/ask spread widens as the amount increases. The price can also depend on the counterparties in the transaction, as anyone with poor credit will find when attempting to take out a loan.</p>
<p>We can combine the prices for all instruments into a vector-value function <span class="math inline">X_t\colon A\times E\times I\times E\to\bm{R}^I</span> where <span class="math inline">X_t(i,a,e,i&#39;,e&#39;)</span> is the <span class="math inline">i</span>-th component of <span class="math inline">X_t(a,e,i&#39;,e&#39;)</span> and we use the same symbol <span class="math inline">X_t</span> for both functions.</p>
<h2 id="cash-flow">Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Holding instruments entails <em>cash flows</em>. A stock pays dividends, a bond pays coupons, a futures has margin adjustments.</p>
<p>Cash flows are functions <span class="math inline">C_t:I\times I\to\bm{R}^I</span>, where <span class="math inline">C_t(i,i&#39;)</span> is the amount of instrument <span class="math inline">i&#39;\in I</span> paid to the holder of <span class="math inline">i\in I</span> at time <span class="math inline">t</span>. Cash flows do not depend on the entity holding the instrument. Usually <span class="math inline">i&#39;</span> is the native currency associated with instrument <span class="math inline">i</span> and is omitted. Specifying <span class="math inline">i&#39;</span> allows for <em>payment-in-kind</em> cash flows.</p>

<p>a sequence of transaction <span class="math inline">\{\chi_j\}</span>…</p>
<p>Define <span class="math inline">\Gamma_t = ...</span>.</p>
<p>The position is <span class="math inline">\Delta_t = \sum_{s &lt; t} \Gamma_t</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>profit and loss</em> of</p>
<h2 id="trading">Trading</h2>
<p>A <em>trading strategy</em> is an increasing sequence of (stopping) times <span class="math inline">(\tau_j)</span> and trades <span class="math inline">\Gamma_j\colon I\times E\times I\times E\to\bm{R}</span> indicating the amount to trade at time <span class="math inline">\tau_j</span> in two instruments between two entities. This results in the exchanges <span class="math inline">\chi_j = (\tau_j;\Gamma_j,i,e;\Gamma_j X_j, i&#39;, e&#39;)</span> where <span class="math inline">\Gamma_j = \Gamma_j(i, e, i&#39;, e&#39;)</span> and <span class="math inline">X_j = X_{\tau_j}(i,\Gamma_j,e,i&#39;,e&#39;)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\iota = (i_\iota, a_\iota, e_\iota)</span> then the position of entity <span class="math inline">e</span> is the set <span class="math inline">\Delta_e = \{\iota\in\mathcal{M} : e_\iota = e\}</span>.</p>

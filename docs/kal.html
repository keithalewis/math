<p>My academic career began as a J. D. Tamarkin assistant professor of
mathematics at Brown before moving on to 10 years as a quant and
technologist at Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley, and Banc of America
Securities. My consulting firm KALX, LLC was founded in 2002 to provide
quantitative and technical support to hedge funds. The primary focus was
on tools to explore, test, and implement trading strategies. Unlike
large investment banks using arbitrage-free models and the law of large
numbers to manage risk, hedge funds actively look for arbitrage to
exploit.</p>
<p>Peter Carr invited me back to the academic world in 2008. I have
taught Derivative Securities courses as an adjunct at Columbia, Cornell,
Rutgers, and NYU. I was surprised to find that there was no proof of The
Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing accessible at the masters level so
I came up with the the <a href="https://kalx.net/um.pdf">Unified
Model</a>. It can be used to value, hedge, and manage the risk of
portfolios containing <em>any</em> collection of instruments.</p>
<p>Some KALX projects: implemented the initial variance swap pricer for
Bloomberg, ran trade execution (3 years) for a client who figured out an
arbitrage on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, assisted the union (1 year)
representing United-Continental-Continental Micronesia Association of
Flight Attendants, analytics for advising on option trades for
Franklin-Templeton SMA’s. From 2015-2018 I was at Bloomberg again to
help on a Management Committee mandated project to provide a data and
compute backbone to be used by all business enterprise units.</p>
<p>My current work involves tax loss harvesting for municipal bonds at
<a href="https://true.market/#">CrossX</a>.</p>

<p><em>Etherium</em> is a computer that anyone can use. Its memory and
programs are available to anyone with sufficient storage and computing
power. In order to add data or run a program you must aquire
<em>ether</em> to pay for <em>gas</em> charges to prove to Etherium
users that you authorized a change in data or a computation. If everyone
trusted each other there would be no need for Etherium.</p>
<p>The first step is to ask Vitalik for a wallet. You will get a unique
id, a public key, and a private key. If someone acquires your private
key they can impersonate you since the public key is used to identify
who is making a transaction.</p>
<p>The second step is to get out your credit card and buy ether from
someone who got there before you. Every Initial Coin Offering is nothing
more than a promise from a bankrupt company. It has no assets. Investors
hope people will invest their money and the value will grow, and be able
to liquidate their postion before the value goes back to zero.</p>

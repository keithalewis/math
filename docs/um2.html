<p><em>If there are no arbitrage opportunities in the capital markets,
then there exists a (not generally unique) valuation operator, <span
class="math inline">L</span></em>.— title: A Basic Unified Model for
Derivative Instruments author: Keith A. Lewis institute: KALX, LLC
fleqn: true classoption: fleqn abstract: Value, hedge, and manage the
risk of any instruments …</p>
<p>The Black-Scholes/Merton theory of option valuation has a serious
flaw: it assumes continous time trading is possible. Only a finite
number of trades can be executed based on information available at the
time of the trade.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Ros1978">(Ross 1978)</span>
extended the B-S/M theory to value any collection of instruments and
identified the condition for models to be arbitrage-free.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If there are no arbitrage opportunities in the capital markets,
then there exists a (not generally unique) valuation operator, <span
class="math inline">L</span></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ross used the Hahn-Banach theorem to show arbitrage is a geometric
notion that has nothing to do with probability. The proposed model puts
Ross’ theory on a firm mathematical basis by identifying his valuation
operator as a <em>deflator</em>: a set of measures indexed by trading
times. Not only are these not unique, as Ross pointed out, the
restriction to a finite number of trades underscores the main unsolved
problem of Mathematical Finance: when and how much should you trade
given available information? This short note does not propose a solution
to this, only a framework for further research.</p>

<h2>Physics</h2>
<p>When observation does not agree with theory in physics, it is time to
come up with a new theory. Lord Kelvin claimed toward the end of the
19th century</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that
remains is more and more precise measurement</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rayleigh-Jeans law for black-body electromagnetic radiation fit
experimental observation for low temperatures, but was drastically wrong
as the temperature increased. Experiment did not agree with
observation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Für die Richtung des dabeieinzuschlagenden Gedankenganges giebt
der Hinblick auf dieUnhaltbarkeit der früher gemachten Voraussetzung
einen Finger-zeig</em>. – Max Planck</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The untenability of the assumption made earlier provides an
indication of the direction of the line of thought to be taken</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Max Planck showed it was possible to fit the observed data by
assuming photons could only be emitted in integer multiples of a minimal
value. Planck’s main contribution to science was not his eponymous
constant that fit the data, it was getting his contemporaries to focus
on understanding why that worked. The result was the development of
quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Stock prices also trade in integer multiples of a minimal value. This
does not necessarialy imply results from quantum mechanics can be
applied to mathematical finance.</p>

<h2>Mathematical Finance</h2>
<p>There is something drastically wrong with the Black-Scholes/Merton
theory due to their assumption of continuous time trading. Merton
provided a closed form formula for the value of barrier options in <span
class="citation" data-cites="Mer1973">(Merton 1973)</span> using the
reflection principal for Brownian motion. A preposterous mathematical
artifact of using Ito’s theory is that it implies the value of a barrier
option does not change if it knocks in (or out) the second, third, or
even the millionth time it is hit.</p>
<p>This untenable conclusion can be avoided by accepting the fact that
every hedging strategy involves only a finite number of trades. There
are no perfect hedges, something every derivative trader knows after the
first week on the job. They just want to know what initial hedge to put
on, and when and how much to adjust the initial hedge over time to
replicate the derivative contract obligations. Half a century on from
B-S/M, the mathematical finance community has not been able to come up
with a mutually agreeable answer to this fundamental problem.</p>
<p>Another pernicious influence of the B-S/M model that <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ros1978">(Ross 1978)</span> pointed out was
arbitrage-free models have nothing to do with probability, they only
involved geometry. We eliminate the use of the Hahn-Banach theorem and
show his linear valuation operator corresponds to a collection of
positive measures indexed by trading time.</p>
<p>Market instruments are not perfectly liquid; there is a bid-ask
spread involved in transactions that tends to widen as the amount traded
increases. Stock prices are discrete; they trade in integer multiples of
their smallest trading unit. The price of an instrument can also depend
on the credit worthiness of the counterparties involved in a trade. The
Basic Unified Model does not address these salient market realities.</p>
<p>The Basic Unified Model does provide a simple and mathematically
rigorous model that can be applied to <em>all</em> instruments.
Instruments have prices and cash flows associated with holding them. A
trading strategy involves only a finite number of trades based on
available information. Trades result in amounts being debited or
credited to a trading account and accumulate to a position in each
instrument. Nominal prices for instruments can be used to approximate
the value (mark-to-market) of the position.</p>
<p>An elementary mathematical consequence of defining price, cash flow,
value, and account is that trading strategies create synthetic
instruments. The value of the strategy corresponds to the price of an
instrument and the amounts in the trading account correspond to cash
flows. This is the skeleton key to valuing, hedging, and managing the
risk of derivatives. A derivative is a contract. The buyer pays the
seller to provide cash flows at times specified in the contract. The
Basic Unified Model does not solve the difficult problems involved with
valuing, hedging, and managing the risk faced by seller. It only
provides a mathematically rigorous notation for investigating this
problem.</p>

### Integration

Integration is a _linear functional_: it assigns a function to a number
where a constant times a function is assigned to the constant
times the integral and the integral of the sum of two functions
is the sum of the integrals. Integration involves _measures_.
A finitely-additive measure is a _set function_ $\lambda\colon\AA\to\RR$ satisfying
$\lambda(A\cup B) = \lambda(A) + \lambda(B) - \lambda(A\cap B)$
and $\lambda(\emptyset) = 0$. Measures don't count things
twice and the measure of the empty set is 0.

If $S$ is a set and $f\colon S\to\RR$ is a function on $S$ define
its _norm_ $\|f\| = \sup_{s\in S} |f(s)|$.
Let $B(S) = \{f\colon S\to\RR\mid \|f\| < \infty\}$ be the
_normed linear space_ of bounded functions on $S$.
The _dual_ of $B(S)$, $B(S)^*$, is the set of all
_bounded linear functionals_ $L\colon B(S)\to\RR$.
A linear functional is bounded if there exists a constant $M\in\RR$
with $|Lf| \le M\|f\|$ for all $f\in B(S)$.
The least such constant is the _norm_ of $L$, $\|L\|$.

Every bounded linear functional gives rise to a finitely-additive
measure $\lambda$ on $S$ by $\lambda(A) = L1_A$.
Let $ba(S)$ denote all finitely-additive measures on $S$.  We now show
how to identify $B(S)^*$ with $ba(S)$.

__Exercise__: _Show $\lambda$ is a measure_.

Every finitely-additive measure gives rise to a linear functional.
We say $f$ is _simple_ if it is a finite linear combination
of indicator functions $f = \sum_j a_j 1_{A_j}$.
Given a measure $\lambda$ define $Lf = \sum_j a_j \lambda(A_j)$.

__Exercise__. _If $\{A_j\}$ are pairwise disjoint show $Lf = 0$
implies $f = 0$_.

__Exercise__. _Show for any collection $\{B_i\}$ we have $\sum_i b_i 1_{B_i} = \sum_j a_j 1_{A_j}$
where $\{A_j\}$ are pairwise disjoint_.

_Hint_: Use $1_{E\cup F} = 1_{E\setminus F} + 1_{F\setminus E} - 1_{E\cap F}$
and induction.

This shows $L$ is _well-defined_ for simple functions.

__Exercise__. _Given any bounded function $g$ and $\epsilon > 0$ there
exists an simple function $f$ with $\|g - f\| < \epsilon$_.

_Hint_: Let $a_n = f(n\epsilon)$ and $A_n = f^{-1}([n\epsilon, (n + 1)\epsilon))$.

This shows the set of simple functions is _dense_ in $B(S)$.
We can extend the definition from simple
functions to all of $B(S)$ since $L$ is bounded

__Exercise__: _If $f\in B(S)$ and $\lim_n f_n = f$
then $\lim_n Lf_n = Lf$_.

_Hint_ Use $L$ is bounded.

This defines the _integral_ $Lf = \int_S f\,d\lambda$.

We can define a norm on $ba(S)$ by $\|\lambda\| = \sup_{\{A_j\}} |\lambda(A_j)|$
where the supremum is over all pairwise disjoint subsets of $S$.

__Exercise__. _Show $\|\lambda\| = \|L\|$_.

If $S$ is finite then $B(S)$ can be identified with $\RR^S = \{f\colon S\to\RR\}$
where $s\mapsto  f(s)$.
Similarly, $ba(S)$ can be identified with $\RR^S = \{\lambda\colon S\to\RR\}$
where $\{s\}\mapsto \lambda(\{s\})$.
This is good news when it comes to computer implementation,
everything is just a finite vector of numbers.

<h3>Probability</h3>
<p>The Unified Model does not involve probability, however as an aid to
those schooled in the classical theory we will reconnoiter some
elementary facts.</p>
<p>A <em>probability measure</em> is a positive measure with mass 1. If
<span class="math inline">P</span> is a probability measure on <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span> then any function <span
class="math inline">X\colon\Omega\to\boldsymbol{R}</span> is a
<em>random variable</em>. The <em>expected value</em> of <span
class="math inline">X</span> is <span class="math inline">E[X] =
\int_\Omega X\,dP</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>conditional probability</em> of <span
class="math inline">B</span> given <span class="math inline">A</span> is
<span class="math inline">P(B\mid A) = P(B\cap A)/P(A)</span> for <span
class="math inline">B,A\subseteq\Omega</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show <span
class="math inline">B\mapsto P(B\mid A)</span> is a probability measure
on <span class="math inline">A</span></em>.</p>
<p>This can be generalized to the conditional expectation of a random
variable given an algebra of sets. We say <span class="math inline">Y =
E[X\mid{\mathcal{A}}]</span> if <span class="math inline">Y</span> is
known given <span class="math inline">{\mathcal{A}}</span> and <span
class="math inline">\int_A Y\,dP = \int_A X\,dP</span> for all <span
class="math inline">A\in{\mathcal{A}}</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">X</span> is a random variable and <span
class="math inline">P</span> is a measure we can define the measure
<span class="math inline">XP</span> by <span class="math inline">(XP)(A)
= \int_A X\,dP</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show <span
class="math inline">XP</span> is a measure</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong> <em>Show if <span class="math inline">X\ge
0</span> and <span class="math inline">E[X] = 1</span> then <span
class="math inline">XP</span> is a probability measure</em>.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: Show <span class="math inline">XP</span> is positive
and <span class="math inline">(XP)(\Omega) = 1</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show <span class="math inline">Y =
E[X|{\mathcal{A}}]</span> if and only if <span
class="math inline">Y(P|_{\mathcal{A}}) =
(XP)|_{\mathcal{A}}</span></em>.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: If <span class="math inline">P</span> is a measure on
<span class="math inline">\Omega</span> then <span
class="math inline">P|_{\mathcal{A}}</span> is the restriction of the
measure to <span class="math inline">{\mathcal{A}}</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. <em>Show if <span
class="math inline">A</span> is an atom of <span
class="math inline">{\mathcal{A}}</span> and <span
class="math inline">P(A)\not=0</span> then <span
class="math inline">E[X\mid{\mathcal{A}}](A) = \int_A

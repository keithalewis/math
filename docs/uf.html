Unified Finance – holdings, trades, and managing risk
</div>
</header>
<p>The financial world is a big, messy affair but its core involves
trading instruments and bean counting: who traded how much of what when
and accounting for that over time.</p>
<p>The atoms of finance are <em>holdings</em>: an <em>amount</em>,
<em>instrument</em>, and <em>legal entity</em>. A <em>position</em> is a
collection of holdings. Holdings interact via <em>trades</em>: the
exchange of holdings between two entities at a given <em>time</em>.
Instruments have <em>cash flows</em> and <em>prices</em> that determine
the <em>amounts</em> and <em>values</em> involved with trading. Given a
position and a sequence of trades, the associated amounts and values
determine the <em>profit and loss</em> (among other quantities) relevant
to managing portfolios.</p>
<p>To properly assess risk it is necessary to include how a position
will be hedged over time. Various hedging strategies can and should be
used for insight on the uncertainties involved.</p>
<p>Both cash flows and prices must be specified by mathematical models
to determine the amounts and values associated with a trading strategy.
It also places instruments on equal footing to get a complete picture of
risk across <strong>all</strong> asset classes. The unified model does
not solve any particular problem in finance but it does specify a
mathematical notation to rigorously discuss all aspects of trading and
hedging using realistic assumptions.</p>
<section id="holding" class="level2">
<h2>Holding</h2>
<p>A holding is an <em>amount</em>, <em>instrument</em>, and <em>legal
entity</em>. Examples of instruments are: stocks, bonds, futures,
currencies, and commodities. They are traded in some amount: shares,
notional, contracts, units, and physical quantity respectively. A legal
entity is an individual or a corporation. Corporations can subdivide
holdings by groups or individual traders. The holding <span
class="math inline">(a,i,e)</span> indicates entity <span
class="math inline">e</span> owns amount <span
class="math inline">a</span> of instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span>.</p>
<p>A <em>position</em> is a set of holdings <span
class="math inline">\{(a_j,i_j,e_j)\}_{j\in J}</span> Assuming each
instrument is <em>fungible</em> we can aggregate amounts. The <em>net
amount</em> in instrument <span class="math inline">i</span> held by
entity <span class="math inline">e</span> is <span class="math display">
    N(i,e) = \sum_j \{a_j : i_j = i, e_j = e\}.
</span> The <em>net position</em> is <span class="math inline">\cup_j
\{(N(i_j,e_j), i_j, e_j)\}</span>. If <span class="math inline">i_j =
i_k</span> and <span class="math inline">e_j = e_k</span>, then <span
class="math inline">N(i_j,e_j) = N(i_k,e_k)</span>; this is standard
mathematical set union.</p>
</section>
<section id="trade" class="level2">
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>A <em>trade</em> involves a pair of holdings and a <em>trade
time</em>. The trade <span class="math inline">(t; a, i, e; a&#39;,
i&#39;, e&#39;)</span> indicates <em>buyer</em> <span
class="math inline">e</span> exchanged amount <span
class="math inline">a</span> of instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span> for amount <span
class="math inline">a&#39;</span> of instrument <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span> with seller <span
class="math inline">e&#39;</span> at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>. The <em>price</em> of the trade is the
quotient of the buyer and seller amounts, <span class="math inline">X =
a/a&#39;</span>, so the trade is <span class="math inline">(t; a&#39;X,
i, e; a&#39;, i&#39;, e&#39;)</span>. Prices are determined by the
seller. The buyer decides when to exchange holdings based on the
seller’s price, among other considerations.</p>
<p>The trade <span
class="math inline">(t;a,i,e;a&#39;,i&#39;,e&#39;)</span> changes the
holdings of the buyer and seller at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>. The holding <span
class="math inline">(a,i,e)</span> of the buyer becomes <span
class="math inline">(a&#39;,i&#39;,e)</span> and the holding <span
class="math inline">(a&#39;,i&#39;,e&#39;)</span> of the seller becomes
<span class="math inline">(a,i,e&#39;)</span>. We assume instruments are
<em>divisible</em> so a holding <span
class="math inline">(a_1,i,e)</span> can be split into <span
class="math inline">(a_1-a_0,i,e)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(a_0,i,e)</span> for any amount <span
class="math inline">a_0</span> at no cost. If <span
class="math inline">0 &lt; a_0 &lt; a_1</span> this assumption is close
to being true.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose a buyer holds 100 dollars <span
class="math inline">(100, \$)</span> and a seller holds two shares of
Ford stock <span class="math inline">(2, F)</span>. If the seller quotes
a price of 8 dollars per share then the buyer can obtain <span
class="math inline">(2, F)</span> by giving the seller <span
class="math inline">(2\times 8, \$)</span> and now holds two shares of
stock and <span class="math inline">(100-16,\$) = (84, \$)</span>.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange is not a special case. If the USD/JPY exchange rate
is 100 then <span class="math inline">(a, \$)</span> can be exchanged
for <span class="math inline">(100a, ¥)</span>. If we write $1 = ¥100
then USD/JPY is 100 where ‘1 =’ turns into ‘<span
class="math inline">/</span>’.</p>
<p>Similarly, commodities are also not special. This model can be used
for <strong>all</strong> instruments.</p>
</section>
<section id="cash-flow" class="level2">
<h2>Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Instruments entail <em>cash flows</em>; stocks pay dividends, bonds
pays coupons, and futures have margin adjustments. Currencies and
commodities do not have cash flows, but they may involve third-party
payments to exchange or store them. Cash flows cause changes to
positions. If instrument <span class="math inline">i</span> pays cash
flow <span class="math inline">C_t(i,i&#39;)</span> per share of <span
class="math inline">i</span> in instrument <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span> at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> then holding <span
class="math inline">(a,i,e)</span> at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> will cause <span class="math inline">(a
C_t(i,i&#39;), i&#39;, e)</span> to be included in the position of <span
class="math inline">e</span> soon after time <span
class="math inline">t</span>. Usually <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span> is the native currency associated with
instrument <span class="math inline">i</span>. Specifying <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span> allows for <em>payment-in-kind</em>
cash flows.</p>
<p>In the Ford example above, when holding <span
class="math inline">\{(86,\$),(2,F)\}</span> and the stock pays a
dividend of <span class="math inline">(0.15, \$)</span> per share then
the holdings become <span class="math inline">\{(86, \$), (2,F),
(2\times 0.15, \$)\}</span> and net to <span
class="math inline">\{(86.30, \$),(2,F)\}</span></p>
<p>Cash flows are zero except at discrete times. Stocks and bonds
typically pay dividends and coupons quarterly or semi-annually. Futures
margin accounts are usually adjusted once per day.</p>
<p>Cash flows do not depend on the entity holding the instrument. They
do depend on the <em>issuer</em> of the instrument, but that is beyond
the scope of this model.</p>
</section>
<section id="profit-and-loss" class="level2">
<h2>Profit and Loss</h2>
<p>Holdings and trades lead to some bean counting over time.</p>
<p>Given a position at time <span class="math inline">t</span>, all
trades and cash flows between <span class="math inline">t</span> and
<span class="math inline">u</span> determine the position at time <span
class="math inline">u</span> as described above. The change in net
amounts is called <em>profit and loss</em> (P&amp;L). If <span
class="math inline">N_t</span> is the net amount defined above then
<span class="math inline">N_u(i,e) - N_t(i,e)</span> is the P&amp;L of
entity <span class="math inline">e</span> in instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span> over the period from <span
class="math inline">t</span> to <span class="math inline">u</span>.</p>
<p>Holdings can be converted into a native currency <span
class="math inline">i_0</span> for reporting purposes. This does not
involve actual trades, only a best guess of the price at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>, <span
class="math inline">X_t(i_0,i)</span>, of each instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span> in terms of <span
class="math inline">i_0</span>. All holdings <span
class="math inline">(a,i,e)</span> are converted to <span
class="math inline">(aX(i_0,i), i_0, e)</span> then netted to report the
P&amp;L in terms of <span class="math inline">i_0</span>.</p>
<p>It is quite common for entities to have different best guesses of
<span class="math inline">X_t(i_0,i)</span>. Accountants might use
“book,” “market,” “liquidation,” or “going concern” values. This model
does not suggest which is the most appropriate in any given situation,
it only makes that choice explicit.</p>
<p>Other relevant quantities can be computed similarly. For example the
<em>drawdown</em> over the period is <span class="math inline">N_u(i,e)
- \min_{t\le s \le u} N_s(i,e)</span> and the <em>drawup</em> is <span
class="math inline">\max_{t\le s\le u} N_s(i,e) - N_u(i,e)</span>.</p>
<p>Any instrument could be used instead of a native currency. A subset
of instruments could also be chosen to break P&amp;L reporting into
components. The set of all currencies involved in a position is a common
choice.</p>
</section>
<section id="model" class="level2">
<h2>Model</h2>
<p>There is no question about cash flows received or prices of trades
after the fact. Mathematics can be used to <em>model</em> possible cash
flows and prices in the future.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">T</span> be the set of trading times,
<span class="math inline">I</span> be the set of instruments, <span
class="math inline">A</span> be the set of amounts, and <span
class="math inline">E</span> be the set of entities.</p>
<p>All models have shortcomings to keep in mind when being applied.
Trading times depend on the instrument and the seller. If an instrument
is listed on an exchange, then it can only be traded during market
hours. Sellers determine when the instruments they offer can be traded.
Amounts are constrained by the instrument, time, and seller. Instruments
trade in finite increments and sometimes cannot be shorted (<span
class="math inline">a&#39; &lt; 0</span> is not allowed). The amount
available is also at the discretion of the seller and may consist of the
empty set for certain buyers.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"

involved to make them mathematically correct.<a href="#fnref2"

<p>A mathematical model for prices is a (partial) function <span

E\to\mathbf{R}</span>. At time <span class="math inline">t</span> the
trade <span class="math inline">(t;a&#39;X_t, i, e;a&#39;, i&#39;,

must give the seller for amount <span class="math inline">a&#39;</span>
of <span class="math inline">i&#39;</span> at time <span

so <span class="math inline">X_t</span> is only a partial function.</p>
<p>Most models of price in the financial literature do not depend on the
amount traded, <span class="math inline">a&#39;</span>, or the
counterparties <span class="math inline">e</span>, or <span
class="math inline">e&#39;</span>. Anyone who has traded knows there are
different prices depending on whether you are buying (<span
class="math inline">a&#39; &gt; 0</span>) or selling (<span
class="math inline">a&#39; &lt; 0</span>) – the ask and the bid price
respectively. Anyone who has traded large amounts also knows the bid/ask
spread widens as the amount gets larger. The price can also depend on
the counterparties in the trade, as anyone with poor credit will find
when attempting to take out a loan.</p>

<h2>Trading</h2>
<p>A <em>trading strategy</em> is an increasing sequence of <em>stopping

</section>
<p>Most models do not specify the seller <span
class="math inline">e&#39;</span>; traders assume there is an aggregate
market of <em>liquidity providers</em> for <span
class="math inline">i&#39;</span>. Usually <span
class="math inline">e</span> is assumed to be a single entity executing
the strategy; however, if you are running a hedge fund you will have a
set of <span class="math inline">e</span>’s called program managers to
reckon with.</p>
<p>The mathematical finance literature customarily assumes a “<em>money
market</em>” account is available to fund trade execution. Funding
trades actually involves many fixed income instruments. Traders at Big
Banks use their <em>funding desk</em> to insulate themselves from the
details, but they are charged for this. Daily positions funded by
<em>repurchase agreements</em> require at least as many instruments as
the number of days involved in trading. These may not be cost effective
for longer term strategies so forward rate agreements and swaps are
often used. The unified model allows these to be easily integrated.</p>
<p>Trades accumulate into positions <span class="math inline">\Delta_t =
\sum_{\tau_j &lt; t} \Gamma_j</span>. If we write <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_t = \Gamma_j</span> if <span
class="math inline">t = \tau_j</span> and <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_t = 0</span> otherwise, this becomes <span
class="math inline">\Delta_t = \sum_{s &lt; t} \Gamma_s</span>. Note the
strict inequality. A trade executed at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> is not included in the position at <span
class="math inline">t</span>; it takes some time for a trade to
settle.</p>
<p>Trading strategies do not explicitly involve cash flows and the
definition of <span class="math inline">\Delta</span> above does not
take those into account. The formula for <em>amount</em> below is used
to do that. Cash flows are typically paid in the native currency and
currencies do not have cash flows. This may explain why cash flows seem
to get short shrift in mathematical finance literature.</p>
<p>Fix the funding currency <span class="math inline">i_0</span> and
write <span class="math inline">\Gamma_t(i_0, i) = \Gamma_t(i)</span>
and <span class="math inline">X_t(i_0, i) = X_t(i)</span>. The
<em>cost</em> of the initial trade in terms of <span
class="math inline">i_0</span> is <span class="math inline">V_0 =
\Gamma_0(i) X_{\tau_0}(i)</span>; buying amount <span
class="math inline">\Gamma</span> at price <span
class="math inline">X</span> costs <span class="math inline">\Gamma
X</span>. This amount will be deducted from the trader’s account and
reported as the value of the initial position to risk management.</p>
<p>If more than one instrument is traded then <span
class="math inline">V_0 = \sum_{i\in I}\Gamma_0(i) X_{\tau_0}(i)</span>.
The sum is over all instruments, but <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_0(i) = 0</span> if <span
class="math inline">i</span> is not traded. If we represent trade
amounts and prices as vectors indexed by instruments, this can be
written as <span class="math inline">V_0 = \Gamma_0\cdot
X_{\tau_0}</span> where dot indicates the <em>inner product</em> of
vectors.</p>
<p>The <em>value</em>, or <em>mark-to-market</em>, of a trading strategy
at time <span class="math inline">t</span> is <span
class="math display">
    V_t = (\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t.
</span> It is the amount the trader would get from unwinding the
existing position and trades just executed at the prevailing market
price, assuming that were possible. Note <span
class="math inline">V_{\tau_0} = \Gamma_0\cdot X_{\tau_0}</span> is the
cost of the initial trade.</p>
<p>Trading strategies cause <em>amounts</em> in <span
class="math inline">i_0</span> to show up in the trader’s account: <span
class="math display">
    A_t = \Delta_t\cdot C_t - \Gamma_t\cdot X_t.
</span> At time <span class="math inline">t</span>, cash flows
proportional the existing position are credited and the cost of trades
just executed are debited. Note <span class="math inline">A_{\tau_0} =
-V_{\tau_0}</span>.</p>
<p>Trading strategies create synthetic instruments. Amounts and values
are proxies for cash flows and prices. A derivative security is a
contract between counterparties for exchanges of future amounts. If a
trading strategy that produces those amounts exists, then its initial
value, plus vigorish, is what a sell-side trader quotes to buy-side
customers. A quants job is to help traders figure out when (<span
class="math inline">\tau_j</span>) and how much (<span
class="math inline">\Gamma_j</span>) to trade in order to satisfy the
contract obligations.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The term <em>self-financing</em>
means satisfying the obligation to pay 0 on non-payment dates.</p>

<p>When <span class="math inline">\Delta_t + \Gamma_t = 0</span>, we say
the trading strategy is <em>closed out</em> at <span

future amounts and values are zero.</p>
<p>If a trading strategy has <span class="math inline">A_{\tau_0} &gt;
0</span>, <span class="math inline">A_t \ge 0</span> for <span
class="math inline">t &gt; \tau_0</span>, and eventually closes out then
<em>arbitrage</em> exists: it is possible to make money on the initial
trade and never lose money over the life of the trading strategy. This
definition of arbitrage depends on the model used for cash flows and
prices.</p>
<p><a href="um.html">The Unified Model</a> describes all arbitrage-free
models. It also shows <span class="math inline">\Delta</span> is delta
and <span class="math inline">\Gamma</span> is gamma.</p>
</section>
<section id="risk" class="level2">
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>The basic problem with most measures of risk is that they fail to
take hedging into account.</p>
<p><em>Value at risk</em> (VaR) is defined using a time period and a
probability <span class="math inline">p</span>. The probability of the
value of a portfolio at the end of the period being less than VaR equals
<span class="math inline">p</span>, assuming no trades occur over the
period. As the length of the period increases, the probability of a
portfolio manager being fired for not hedging it approaches 1.</p>
<p>VaR can be turned into a more useful measure by incorporating the
hedging strategy. Different hedging strategies can be compared for their
effectiveness. Of course drawup and drawdown should also be considered
instead of only the value of the hedged portfolio at one point in
time.</p>
<p>Similarly, CVA fails to take into account hedging. The CVA of a
portfolio is <span class="math inline">\int_T \max\{E[V_t], 0\}
h(t)\,dt</span> where <span class="math inline">V_t</span> is the value
of the portfolio at <span class="math inline">t</span> and <span
class="math inline">h</span> is a given <em>haircut</em>. The term <span
class="math inline">\max\{V_t, 0\}</span> is the <em>exposure</em> of
the portfolio holder.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Holders are not exposed to
counterparty risk if they owe money. The insurance industry had been
using this formula to calculate premiums long before it showed up in the
financial world. The 1933 Glass-Steagall Act prohibited investment banks
from participating in the insurance industry, but after the merger of
Citicorp with Travelers, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allowed them into
the party after 1999.</p>

class="math inline">E[\max\{V_t,0\}] \ge\max\{E[V_t], 0\}</span> so CVA
underestimates the risk.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"

<p>It is common for swaps to have unwind provisions that will be
exercised if the market moves against them. This is an example of a
hedging strategy that can be applied to a portfolio to get a more
accurate estimate of counterparty risk. The CVA haircut should not be
applied to a holding that no longer belongs to the portfolio.</p>
<p>DVA is just the CVA of the entity on the other side of the trades.
The menagerie of XVA measures are attempts to incorporate special case
hedging strategies or cash flows due to taxes or regulatory capital
requirements. They can all be replaced by explicitly incorporating the
appropriate trading strategy and cash flows involved when applying the
cost of insurance formula.</p>

<h2>Model Risk</h2>
<p>The two fundamental problems of risk management are that there is no
clear definition of risk and it is impossible to manage something that
is not clearly defined. The term <em>model risk</em> is even more
unclear – exactly what models are under consideration?</p>
<p>One universal property is when a new model is introduced there is
always a P&amp;L hit. Trades undervalued by the old model were executed
by counterparties who recognized that, and trades overvalued by the old
model found few takers.</p>
<p>In lieu of a proper theory of risk management, the best that can be
accomplished is to make implicit assumptions explicit and provide
multiple models and more efficient reporting tools to allow risk
managers to quickly and easily assess the effects of the assumptions
they make.</p>
<p>Capturing every holding and transaction in a database turns
historical reporting into a well understood technology problem. When
decorated with appropriate dimensions and measures, risk managers can
use off-the-shelf tools to create dynamic reports allowing them to
summarize data and drill down to individual holdings and transactions to
their heart’s content. It is no longer necessary to have technologists
spend time developing custom reports.</p>
<p>Models can be used to generate scenarios for future cash flows and
prices. Trading strategies use these to determine holdings over time.
The same queries designed for historical reporting can be reused to give
a probability distribution for any values of interest.</p>
<p>The future of risk management is to use Monte Carlo methods to
generate scenarios given a model and trading strategy. Existing models
can be leveraged to do this. Off-the-shelf tools can already report
mean, standard deviation, and quantiles for probability distributions.
The only hurdle is computing power, but we have Moore’s Law on our side.
Software built today can be used without change to give better and
faster answers in the future.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>A <em>funding account</em> is more complicated than it might seem at
first blush. A <em>funding desk</em> provides a liquid market in a
native currency to traders for <em>funding</em> their trades. One way to
think of it is as a perpetual bond; for unit notional you get a daily
stream of coupons. The coupons are not constant but they are known at
the beginning of each period<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and are usually tied to
short-term market rates. A trading strategy involves many transactions
in the market account and it is common to implicitly assume all holdings
are reinvested in the account. A funding desk typically uses the
<em>repurchase agreement</em> market to supply the account. There are
many individual transactions involved with funding accounts once you
pull out your microscope.</p>
<section class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-block" role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="6">
<li id="fn6" role="doc-endnote"><p>The coupons are a stochastic process
that is called <em>predictable</em> in the math literature. It means
that it is a little better than being merely <em>adapted</em> to a
<em>filtration</em>.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"

<p>Trades often involve the exchange of more than two holdings, for
example, a fee or commission to a broker or market maker that enabled
the trade. These are accommodated by including the associated
transactions as trades with the third parties involved. Perhaps these
should be called the molecules of finance.</p>
<p>The financial world is still waiting for its Werner Heisenberg. The
price of a trade after it has been executed is a number: the amount the
buyer gave to the seller divided by the amount the seller gave to the
buyer. The price prior to completing a trade is more nebulous. The
difference between a price quoted prior to a trade and the realized
price after settlement is lumped into the term <em>slippage</em>.
Accurately modeling that uncertainty is an ongoing puzzle.</p>
<p>For trades on an exchange, the order book can give a better handle on
what the slippage might be. Some exchanges report the net amount of
limit orders they have near the current market level. If a market order
is not too large then the levels of the limit orders it will match can
be determined. However, other customers or liquidity providers can cause
changes to the order book before a market orders is executed to cause
uncertainty in the exact amounts of matching limit orders at each
level.</p>
<p>There is a clear trajectory in Mathematical Finance starting from the
Black-Scholes/Merton model of a single option parameterized by a
constant volatility to portfolios of instruments belonging to the same
asset class that use increasingly sophisticated models that can be
parameterized to fit all available market data.</p>
<p>The future of Mathematical Finance is developing more accurate models
that allow for incorporating potential trading strategies and extending
the set of instruments to all asset classes. Advances in big data and
computation speed will eventually allow real-time interactive dashboards
allowing traders and risk managers to get a better understanding of the
uncertainties involved with trading.</p>
<p>A currently intractable problem is how to rapidly tune models to fit
market data. It is essentially an interpolation problem: given data
<span class="math inline">(x_j, y_j)</span> find a function <span
class="math inline">f</span> with <span class="math inline">f(x_j)
\approx y_j</span> for all <span class="math inline">j</span>. This
falls under the purview of machine learning. It is my hope that the
large ML cadre currently employed to tell us pictures that look like a
blur to humans have a 95% probability of being a stop sign can be
gainfully redirected to more useful purposes.</p>

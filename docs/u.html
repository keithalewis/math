<p>Instruments have <em>prices</em> and <em>cash flows</em>. Trading
instruments result in cash flows to the <em>trading account</em>; you
buy and sell at prevailing prices and receive cash flows associated with
each instrument proportional to your current position. The
mark-to-market of a position and cash flows associated with trading
correspond to the price and cash flows of a synthetic instrument.</p>
<p>A <em>derivative</em> is a contract specifying cash flows. If a
trading strategy replicates the cash flows then the value of the
derivative is the cost of the initial hedging position. Risk management
involves measuring how well a trading strategy replicates cash flows
specified by the contract.</p>
<p>A <em>money market</em> account is assumed to be available for
financing trading strategies. The price of the money market at time
<span class="math inline">t</span> is denoted <span
class="math inline">R_t</span> and has no cash flows. Let <span
class="math inline">D_t = 1/R_t</span> be the <em>deflator</em>.</p>
<section id="price-and-cash-flow" class="level2">
<h2>Price and Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Given a deflator, every model is specified by a vector-valued
<em>martingale</em> <span class="math inline">M_t</span> indexed by
instruments. Prices <span class="math inline">X_t</span> and cash flows
<span class="math inline">C_t</span> must satisfy <span
class="math display">
    X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s\le t} C_s D_s
</span> in any arbitrage-free model. Note if there are no cash flows
then this implies the deflated prices, <span class="math inline">X_t
D_t</span>, are a martingale. In general, <span class="math inline">C_t
= 0</span> except at a discrete set of times.</p>
<p>For example, the Black-Scholes/Merton model has money market <span
class="math inline">R_t = e^{\rho t}</span> and martingale <span
class="math inline">S_t = s e^{\sigma B_t - \sigma^2t/2}</span> where
<span class="math inline">B_t</span> is standard Brownian motion.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">I</span> be a set of instruments and
<span class="math inline">T</span> be a (totally ordered) set of trading
times. Assume the standard setup <span
class="math inline">\langle\Omega,P,(\mathcal{A}_t)_{t\in
T}\rangle</span> where <span class="math inline">\Omega</span> is the
sample space of all possible outcomes, <span
class="math inline">P</span> is a probability measure on <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}_t</span> is an algebra of sets on <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span> indicating the information available
at time <span class="math inline">t</span>.</p>
<p>We use the notation <span
class="math inline">X\colon\Omega\to\mathcal{A}</span> to indicate <span
class="math inline">X\colon\Omega\to\mathbf{R}</span> is <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span>-measurable where <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span> is an algebra of sets. If the
algebra is finite then <span class="math inline">X</span> is <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span>-measurable if and only if it is
constant on atoms of <span class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span> so
<span class="math inline">X</span> <em>is</em> a function from <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span> to the atoms of <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span
class="math inline">X_t^i\colon\Omega\to\mathcal{A}_t</span> be the
price and <span
class="math inline">C_t^i\colon\Omega\to\mathcal{A}_t</span> be the cash
flow of instrument <span class="math inline">i\in I</span> at time <span
class="math inline">t\in T</span>. We also write this as <span
class="math inline">X_t,C_t\colon\Omega\to\mathcal{A}_t</span> where
<span class="math inline">X_t</span> and <span
class="math inline">C_t</span> are vectors indexed by the set of
instruments when that is understood.</p>
<p>A consequence of the formula <span class="math inline">X_t D_t = M_t
+ \sum_{s\le t} C_s D_s</span> is <span class="math display">
X_t D_t = E_t[X_u D_u + \sum_{t\le s &lt; u}C_s D_s]
</span> where <span class="math inline">E_t</span> is conditional
expectation at time <span class="math inline">t</span> and <span
class="math inline">u &gt; t</span>. Note if <span
class="math inline">X_t D_t</span> goes to zero as <span
class="math inline">t</span> goes to infinity then <span
class="math inline">X_0 = E[\sum_{t \ge 0} C_t D_t]</span>. In this case
price is the expected value of deflated future cash flows.</p>
<p>The formula follows from <span class="math display">
\begin{aligned}
E_t[X_u D_u + \sum_{t\le s &lt; u}C_s D_s]
&amp;= E_t[(M_u - \sum_{s\le u}C_s D_s) + \sum_{t\le s &lt; u}C_s D_s]
\\
&amp;= E_t[M_u - \sum_{s\le t}C_t D_s] \\
&amp;= M_t - \sum_{s\le t}C_s D_s \\
&amp;= X_t D_t \\

<section id="value-and-account" class="level2">
<h2>Value and Account</h2>
<p>Market participants <em>trade</em> instruments. We assume an initial
position <span class="math inline">M_0</span> in the money market
instrument. A <em>trading strategy</em> is a finite sequence of strictly
increasing (stopping) times <span class="math inline">\tau_j</span> and
vector-valued random variables <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_j\colon\Omega\to\mathcal{A}_{\tau_j}</span>
of amounts amounts purchased in each instrument at these times. Trades
accrue to a <em>position</em> <span class="math inline">\Delta_t =
\sum_{s &lt; t} \Gamma_s</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_s = \Gamma_j</span> if <span
class="math inline">s = \tau_j</span> and is zero otherwise. The trades
show up in the trade <em>account</em> as cash flows <span
class="math display">
A_t = \Delta_t\cdot C_t - \Gamma_t\cdot X_t.
</span> You receive all cash flows in proportion to your existing
position and pay for the trades just executed. Let <span
class="math display">
V_t = (\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t
</span> be the <em>value</em>, or <em>marked-to-market</em>, of the
strategy at time <span class="math inline">t</span>. It is the amount in
terms of the money market instrument of unwinding the current position
and trades just executed at prevailing prices.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>. <em>Using the definitions above</em> <span
class="math display">
V_t D_t = E_t[V_u D_u + \sum_{t\le s &lt; u}A_s D_s].
</span> Note how <span class="math inline">V_t</span> and <span
class="math inline">A_t</span> play the role of price and cash flow
respectively. Trading strategies create synthetic market
instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. If <span class="math inline">u &gt; t</span>
is sufficiently small then <span class="math inline">Δ_t + Γ_t =
Δ_u</span> is <span class="math inline">\mathcal{A}_t</span>-measurable.
Since <span class="math inline">X_t D_t = E_t[(X_u + C_u) D_u]</span> we
have <span class="math display">
\begin{aligned}
    V_t D_t &amp;= (Δ_t + Γ_t)\cdot X_t D_t\\
            &amp;= Δ_u\cdot X_t D_t\\
            &amp;= Δ_u\cdot E_t[(X_u + C_u) D_u]\\
            &amp;= E_t[Δ_u\cdot(X_u + C_u) D_u]\\

            &amp;= E_t[(V_u + A_u)D_u],\\

<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>A model is specified by a deflator <span
class="math inline">D_t</span> and a martingale <span
class="math inline">M_t</span>. The reciprocal of the deflator <span
class="math inline">R_t = 1/D_t</span> is the money market insturment
and has no cash flows. Prices <span class="math inline">X_t</span> and
cash flows <span class="math inline">C_t</span> under the model satisfy
<span class="math inline">X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s\le t} C_s D_s</span>.
A consequence is <span class="math display">
X_t D_t = E_t[X_u D_u + \sum_{t\le s &lt; u}C_s D_s].
</span> A trading strategy <span class="math inline">(\tau_j,

\Gamma_t)\cdot X_t</span> and account cash flows <span
class="math inline">A_t = \Delta_t\cdot C_t - \Gamma_t\cdot X_t</span>
where <span class="math inline">\Delta_t = \sum_{\tau_j &lt; t} \Gamma_j
= \sum_{s &lt; t} \Gamma_s</span>. A consequence is <span
class="math display">
V_t D_t = E_t[V_u D_u + \sum_{t\le s &lt; u}A_s D_s].
</span></p>
</section>
<section id="arbitrage" class="level2">
<h2>Arbitrage</h2>
<p><em>Arbitrage</em> exists (given <span class="math inline">D_t</span>
and <span class="math inline">M_t</span>) if there is a finite trading
strategy <span class="math inline">(\tau_j, \Gamma_j)</span> with <span
class="math inline">A_{\tau_0} &gt; 0</span>, <span
class="math inline">A_t \ge 0</span> for <span class="math inline">t
&gt; \tau_0</span>, and <span class="math inline">\sum \Gamma_j =
0</span>; you make money on the initial trade and never lose money after
that. The position must eventually be <em>closed out</em>, <span
class="math inline">\sum_j \Gamma_j = 0</span>.</p>
<p>For a trading strategy that closes out <span
class="math inline">V_{τ_0} D_{τ_0} = E_{τ_0}[\sum_{t &gt;
τ_{0}}{A_{t}D_{t}] \ge 0}</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">V_{τ_0} = Γ_{τ_0} \cdot X_{τ_0}</span>, <span
class="math inline">A_{τ_0} = - Γ_{τ_0} \cdot X_{τ_0}</span> and <span
class="math inline">D_{τ_0} &gt; 0</span> we have <span
class="math inline">A_{τ_0} \le 0</span>. This shows no arbitrage can
exist for models where prices and cash flows satisfy <span
class="math inline">X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s\le t}C_s D_s</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="hedging" class="level2">
<h2>Hedging</h2>
<p>Given cash flows <span class="math inline">(A_t)_{t\in T}</span> does
there exist a trading strategy <span class="math inline">(\tau_j,
\Gamma_j)</span> producing such <span class="math inline">A_t</span>?
Assume <span class="math inline">T = \{t_j\}</span> with <span
class="math inline">t_j</span> increasing. Using <span
class="math inline">V_0 = (\Delta_0 + \Gamma_0)\cdot X_0</span> and
<span class="math inline">V_0 = E[\sum_{t\ge 0}A_t D_t]</span> we have
<span class="math inline">\Delta_0 + \Gamma_0 = \mathcal{D}_{X_0}
E[\sum_{t\ge 0}A_t D_t]</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{D}_X</span> denotes the Fréchet derivative
with respect to <span class="math inline">X</span>. Similarly, <span
class="math inline">\Delta_j + \Gamma_j = \mathcal{D}_{X_j}
E_{t_j}[\sum_{t\ge t_j}A_t D_t]</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\Delta_0 = 0</span> this gives necessary conditions
for determining <span class="math inline">\Gamma_j</span>. The value of
a derivative is the cost of setting up the initial hedge. <span
class="math inline">\Delta</span> is the derivative of value with
respect to underlying and <span class="math inline">\Gamma</span> the
amount by which the delta hedge must be changed.</p>
<p>These are not sufficient conditions. By definition we always have
<span class="math inline">V_j = (\Delta_j + \Gamma_j)\cdot X_j</span>.
The position will accrue to <span class="math inline">(\Delta_j +
\Gamma_j)\cdot X_{j+1}</span> at time <span
class="math inline">t_{j+1}</span> but there is no guarantee this will
equal <span class="math inline">V_{j+1}</span>. The difference is the
<em>profit and loss</em> for the hedge over the period from <span
class="math inline">t_j</span> to <span class="math inline">t_{j +
1}</span>. Since <span class="math inline">V_t</span> is a function of
<span class="math inline">X_t</span> and <span
class="math inline">D_t</span> we can write a Taylor expansion for <span
class="math inline">\Delta V_t = V_{t + \Delta t} - V_t</span> in terms
of powers of <span class="math inline">\Delta X_t</span> and <span
class="math inline">\Delta D_t</span>. Risk managers use the higher
order derivatives to “explain” profit and loss. Traders have to deal
with the fact that the imperfect hedge throws off their replication.
Quants have not yet devised a coherent theory to help traders deal with
the various heuristics they have invented to account for this.</p>
</section>
<section id="instruments" class="level2">
<h2>Instruments</h2>
<p>We now apply the model to various instruments.</p>
<section id="futures" class="level3">
<h3>Futures</h3>
<p>A <em>futures</em> contract is specified by an underlying and an
expiration. If <span class="math inline">S_t</span> is the price of the
underlying at time <span class="math inline">t</span> and <span
class="math inline">T</span> is the expiration of the futures then the
futures <em>quote</em> <span class="math inline">\Phi_T</span> at <span
class="math inline">T</span> is <span class="math inline">S_T</span>.
Prior to that the futures quote <span class="math inline">\Phi_t</span>,
<span class="math inline">t &lt; T</span>, is determined by the exchange
issuing the futures contract.</p>
<p>When trading on an exchange an initial margin must be provided. The
exchange specifies <em>margin adjustment</em> times <span
class="math inline">t_j</span> that cause cash flows in margin accounts
<span class="math inline">C_{t_j} = \Phi_{t_j} - \Phi_{t_{j-1}}</span>.
The price of a futures is always zero so <span class="math inline">0 =
E_{t_{j-1}}[C_{t_j}D_{t_j}]</span>. Assuming <span
class="math inline">D_{t_j}</span> is <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}_{t_{j-1}}</span>-measurable then <span
class="math inline">\Phi_{t_{j-1}} = E_{t_{j-1}}[\Phi_{t_j}]</span>.
This provides justification for assuming futures quotes are a
martingale, <span class="math inline">\Phi_t = E_t[S_T]</span>, <span
class="math inline">t\le T</span>.</p>
<p>One might think the problem of modeling instrument prices can be
solved by specifying the price at some future time <span
class="math inline">T</span> and let <span class="math inline">S_t D_t =
E_t[S_T] - \sum_{t &lt; s \le T} C_s D_s</span>. This only moves the
question of price dynamics to computing the conditional expectations
<span class="math inline">E_t</span>. In order to do that we need to
specify the filtration $<span class="math inline">\mathcal{A}_t)</span>
however this is a highly underdetermined problem, albiet worthwhile to
consider.</p>

<section id="zero-coupon-bonds" class="level3">
<h3>Zero Coupon Bonds</h3>
<p>A <em>zero coupon bond</em> <span class="math inline">D(t)</span> has
cash flow 1 at <span class="math inline">t</span>. Its value at time
zero is is <span class="math inline">V_0 = E[1 D_t]</span>. Its value at

of the instrument.</p>
</section>
<section id="forward-rate-agreements" class="level3">
<h3>Forward Rate Agreements</h3>
<p>A <em>forward rate agreement</em> has two cash flows: <span
class="math inline">C_t = -1</span> at the <em>effective date</em> <span
class="math inline">t</span> and <span class="math inline">C_u = 1 +
f\delta(t,u)</span> at the termination date <span
class="math inline">u</span>, where <span class="math inline">f</span>
is the <em>rate</em> and <span class="math inline">\delta(t,u)</span> is
the <em>day count fraction</em>. The day count fraction uses a <em>day
count basis</em> to convert an interval of time into a number
approximately equal to <span class="math inline">u - t</span> in years.
For example the <em>Actual/360</em> day count basis is the difference in
days from <span class="math inline">t</span> to <span
class="math inline">u</span> divided by 360.</p>
<p>The <em>par forward rate</em> is the rate that makes the initial
value zero <span class="math inline">0 = E[-1 D_t + (1 +
f\delta)D_u]</span>. The par forward rate at time <span
class="math inline">s\le t</span>, <span
class="math inline">F_s^\delta(t,u)</span>, satisfies <span
class="math display">
    0 = E_s[-1 D_t + (1 + F_s^\delta(t,u)) D_u]
</span> so <span class="math inline">F_s^\delta(t,u) =
(E_s[D_t]/E_s[D_u] - 1)/\delta(t,u) = (D_s(t)/D_s(u) -
1)/\delta(t,u)</span>.</p>

<h3>Stock Dividends</h3>
<p>Some stocks pay dividends that are determined by the issuer. A
<em>cash dividend</em> is a fixed amount <span

class="math inline">u</span>. The stock price satisfies <span

term dividends are usually announced several months in advance. Longer
term dividends are unknown but it is reasonable to assume the dividends
will be larger if the stock increases in price and smaller if it
decreases.</p>
<p>A <em>hybrid model</em> specifies both proportional and discrete
dividends; the stock pays <span class="math inline">\delta_u S_u +

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Repurchase agreements determine the deflator.</p>
<p>Stocks have dividends, bonds have coupons, futures have daily margin
adjustments. An European option has a single cash flow at expiration.
Currencies and commodities do not have cash flows.</p>
<p>This model does not incorporate bid-ask spreads. The spread also
depends on the amount being transacted and the credit quality of the two
parties involved in the transaction. Cash flows are determined by the
<em>issuer</em> of the instrument and are usually zero. Transactions
often involve cash flows with third parties such as broker commissions
or borrowing costs. These considerations will be ignored, for now.</p>

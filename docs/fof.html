<p><em>Issuers</em> create <em>instruments</em>. A company can issue stocks or bonds to raise capital, exchanges create contracts to connect liquidity providers with their customers. Commodities originate from producers of the physical product and currencies are issued by governments of countries.</p>
<p>Some instruments have <em>cash flows</em>. Stocks may have dividends, bonds may have coupons, futures have periodic margin adjustments. Commodities and currencies do not have cash flows. The <em>issuer</em> of an instrument determines when and what amount to give per unit of amount to instrument holders.</p>
<p>A <em>holding</em> is an <em>amount</em> of an <em>instrument</em> held by a <em>legal entity</em>. Amounts have units based on the instrument: stocks have <em>shares</em>, bonds have <em>notional</em>, futures have <em>contract size</em>. Commodities have physical quantities and currencies have denominations.</p>
<p>Holdings are <em>transacted</em> over time. <em>Sellers</em> determine what holdings they are willing to exchange with <em>buyers</em>. Buyers decide when to transact an available exchange of holdings with a seller. A transaction involves a <em>trade date</em>, <em>settlement date</em>, and an exchange of holdings between a <em>buyer</em> and a <em>seller</em>. The <em>price</em> of the transaction is the quotient of the buyer amount and the seller amount. Ownership of holdings is transferred on the settlement date. The <em>position</em> of an entity is their set of holdings at any given time.</p>
<p>The sum of the amounts of each instrument in a position is the <em>net</em> position in that instrument. Given prices of instruments in some currency, the net positions can be converted to the <em>value</em>, <em>mark-to-market</em>, of the position in that currency. Accountants call this the <em>balance sheet</em>. The difference of the net value of positions at the beginning and end of a period is the <em>profit and loss</em> over the period.</p>
<p>Profit and loss does not capture the dynamics over the period. Cash flows and transactions cause changes to positions. Instrument holders receive cash flows based on the amount held, transactions involve an exchange of holdings between the buyer and seller. These show up in the trade blotter <em>account</em>. Accountants call this the <em>cash flow statement</em>.</p>
<p>Ignoring taxes, lawyers, and events of God, this is a complete vocabulary for discussing everything involved with accounting for financial activity.</p>

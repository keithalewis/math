<p>Most mathematical finance models lack some important real-world
features. It is customary to assume there is only one entity, the
trader, involved in a trading strategy. The trader/buyer decides what
hedging should be done, but the issuer/seller sometimes also has a say.
For example, a callable bond allows the issuer to revoke ownership from
the buyer by providing an early principal payment. The initial
transaction also typically involves a third entity, the broker/dealer or
an exchange, that receives a cash flow for providing liquidity. It is
rare to find a model that accounts for taxes that must be paid due to
trading activity. These can amount to a significant fraction of the cash
flows involved and depend on the entities invovled.</p>
<p>We outline a treatment that allows more realistic modeling. It is
essential to identify who owns what amount in each instrument. Holding
an instrument often involves cash flows that depend on the amount held
and the entity holding it. Holdings are transacted over time at a price.
Each entity decides when and how much of each instrument they wish to
trade. A complete model must allow for trading strategies to be
specified by each entity.</p>
<p>Issuers create instruments. A company can issue stocks or bonds to
raise capital, exchanges create contracts to connect liquidity providers
with their customers. Commodities originate from producers of the
physical product and currencies are issued by governments of
countries.</p>
<p>Some instruments have cash flows. Stocks may have dividends, bonds
may have coupons, futures have periodic margin adjustments. Commodities
may involve holding costs. Futures always have price zero and only pay
margin adjustment cash flows. Currencies do not have cash flows. The
issuer of an instrument determines when and how much to give per unit of
amount to instrument holders.</p>
<p>A holding is an amount of an instrument held by a legal entity.
Amounts have units based on the instrument: stocks have shares, bonds
have notional, futures have contract size. Commodities have physical
quantities and currencies have denominations. Currencies never have cash
flows. The price of a futures is always zero.</p>
<p>Holdings are transacted over time. Sellers determine what holdings
they are willing to exchange with buyers. Buyers decide when to transact
an available exchange of holdings with a seller. A transaction involves
a trade date, settlement date, and an exchange of holdings between the
buyer and seller. The price of the transaction is the quotient of the
buyer amount and the seller amount. Ownership of holdings is transferred
on the settlement date. The position of an entity is their set of
holdings at any given time.</p>
<p>The sum of the amounts held of each instrument in a position is the
net position in that instrument. Given prices of instruments in some
currency, the net positions can be converted to the value, or
mark-to-market, of the position in that currency. Determining the
‚Äúprice‚Äù of an illiquid instrument is problematic. The difference of the
net value of positions at the beginning and end of a period is the
profit and loss over the period.</p>
<p>Profit and loss does not capture the dynamics over the period. Cash
flows and transactions cause changes to positions. Instrument holders
receive cash flows based on the amount held and transactions involve an
exchange of holdings between the buyer and seller. These show up in the
trade blotter account. Other measures such as drawdown can be used to
mangage trading risk and determine trading strategy.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">E</span> be the set of market

<p>Let <span class="math inline">I</span> be the set of market

<p>Let <span class="math inline">A = ùëπ</span>, be the set of real

<p>A <em>holding</em> is a triple <span class="math inline">(a, i, e)\in
A\times I\times E</span> indicating entity <span
class="math inline">e</span> hold amount <span
class="math inline">a</span> of instrument <span
class="math inline">i</span>.</p>
<p>A <em>transaction</em> is an exchange of two holdings between a
<em>buyer</em> and a <em>seller</em> at a time <span
class="math inline">t</span>. Sellers offer potential transactions to
buyers who decide whether or not to accept them. This corresponds to
buy-side and sell-side firms.</p>
<p>The market at time <span class="math inline">t</span> is the set of
all holdings <span class="math inline">\mathcal{H}_t =
\{(a,i,e)\}</span>. If a buyer holding <span
class="math inline">(a,i,e)</span> accepts a seller‚Äôs offer of <span
class="math inline">(a&#39;,i&#39;,e&#39;)</span> then the market
holdings are changed. The holdings <span
class="math inline">(a,i,e)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(a&#39;,i&#39;,e&#39;)</span> become <span
class="math inline">(a&#39;,i&#39;,e)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(a,i,e&#39;)</span> when the transaction settles.
The price of the transaction is <span class="math inline">X =
a&#39;/a</span>.</p>
<p>The market gets updated by <em>cash flows</em> even if there are no
transactions. If the holding <span class="math inline">(a,i,e)</span>
recieves a cash flow <span class="math inline">(b,&#39;,e)</span> at
time <span class="math inline">t</span> that is added to <span

<p>The <em>net</em> amount entity <span class="math inline">e</span>
holds in instrument <span class="math inline">i</span> is <span

(a&#39;,i&#39;,e&#39;)\in\mathcal{H}_t, i&#39; = i, e&#39; = e\}.

Sometimes you need math.

<p>It is quite rare that mathematics can be applied to financial
problems. Businesses face many problems that cannot be reduced to
statements that are either true or false that can be derived from axioms
using rules of inference. On the occasions that mathematics can be used
there is often no other way of solving a problem.</p>
<p>When I worked at a sell-side Big Bank a company we will refer to as D
came to us with a problem to solve. They issued an IPO to raise capital
and were very successful at turning a profit. As is quite common in this
situation, they wanted to use their profits to buy back shares they
issued. They were about to issue an earnings announcement that they knew
would cause their stock price to go down and wanted to buy back shares
at a lower price. People running a company have the best inside
information.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that would most likely result in their CFO doing jail
time. Mathematical finance papers rarely mention legal issues involved
with trading, but people running a business have to pay attention. There
is a lockout period after earnings announcements forbidding companies to
transact their stock shares.</p>
<p>One way to lock in a lower price for their buyback is to purchase a
call option. It is legal to do this as long as the call expiration date
is after the lockout period. The company can choose the strike equal to
their target buyback price. At expiration the call option will pay the
difference between the price at expiration and the strike if that is
positive. But D knew something no option issuer did: they were
overvaluing the option. The option issuer will value it using the
discounted risk-neural expected payoff of the call without incorporating
the knowledge D has about its price drastically dropping in the near
future.</p>
<p>D gave BigBank this information so we were able to offer them a lower
price on the call option that our lawyers advised was legal. It seemed
like secondhand insider information to me at the time. D thought it was
still too expensive. They knew the stock price would spike down but gave
us the option of not paying the call if it didnâ€™t.</p>
<p>This is called a down-and-in barrier option. It pays the call if the
stock price goes below a specified level at any point before expiration.
Robert Merton III showed how to price a barrier option assuming constant
volatility in 1976 using the reflection principle for Brownian motion.
BigBank used that to offer them an even cheaper price if they let us
know what knock-in barrier they wanted to use.</p>
<p>D was still not happy with the price quoted based on the barrier
level they gave us. They knew the barrier would be hit shortly after
their earnings announcement. At the time, I worked with Peter Carr who
wrote a paper on early ending barrier options. The call only knocks in
if the barrier is hit at a specified time prior to expiration.</p>
<p>This is an example of where mathematics can be applied to financial
engineering problems. No trader on the BigBank desk had ever heard of
early ending barrier options until Peter Carr showed them how to make
this trade happen. BigBank made 9 bucks on the trade and Peter and I got
a good bonus that year.</p>
<p>Something we were unable to figure out was how traders decided to
quote a price that was $9MM above what we told them the risk-neutral
price was. Mathematics was not useful in figuring out that problem.</p>

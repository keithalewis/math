<blockquote>
<p>A <em>derivative</em> is a legal contract. The <em>buyer</em> chooses
a <em>seller</em> agree to exchange future <em>cash flows</em>. The
seller quotes a <em>price</em> to the buyer and both parties are
obligated to make good on the agreed cash flows after the trade.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Traders buy and sell shares of instruments and eventually close out
their position.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Market instruments can be bought or sold at a price and ownership
entails cash flows. Shares of instruments can be traded based on
available information and accumulate to positions. The mark-to-market
value and amounts involved with trading correspond to price and cash
flows respectively. The Unified Model demonstrates the connection
between dynamic trading and how to value, hedge, and manage the risk of
any portfolio.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every arbitrage-free model of prices and cash flows is parameterized
by a vector-valued martingale whose components are indexed by market
instruments and a positive, adapted process called a deflator. If
repurchase agreements are available the canonical deflator is the
reciprocal of the money market account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>derivative security</em> is a contract between two parties: I
will give you this on these dates if you will give me that on those
dates. Derivatives must have existed since before recorded history. The
Nobel prize winning breakthrough of Black, Scholes, and Merton was how
to synthesize derivatives by dynamically trading market instruments
based on the borrowing cost used to fund the hedge instead of trying to
estimate the growth rate of the underlying securities.</p>
<p>This paper provides a unified model for valuing, hedging, and
managing the risk of any derivative security. It shows how they can be
synthesized by trading market instruments and turns the spotlight on
what may be the next Nobel prize winning problem: how should you hedge
if you can’t do it continuously?</p>
<p>The Unified Model can be used for any portfolio of stocks, bonds,
currencies, commodities, and even other derivatives in the
portfolio.</p>
<section id="market-model" class="level2">
<h2>Market Model</h2>
<p>We assume the usual setup, <span class="math inline">\langle Ω, P,
(\mathcal{A}_t)_{t\in T}\rangle</span>, of a sample space <span
class="math inline">Ω</span>, a probability measure <span
class="math inline">P</span>, and an increasing filtration of algebras
<span class="math inline">(\mathcal{A}_t)</span> over the set of trading
times <span class="math inline">T</span>. If you are not familiar with
this see the <a href="#notation">Notation</a> section below.</p>
<p>Every <em>instrument</em> has a <em>price</em> <span
class="math inline">X_t</span> and a <em>cash flow</em> <span
class="math inline">C_t</span> at any trading time <span
class="math inline">t\in T</span>. Instruments are assumed to be
perfectly liquid: they can be bought or sold at the given price in any
amount. Cash flows are associated with owning an instrument and are
almost always 0; stocks have dividends, bonds have coupons, currencies
have no cash flows, commodities have storage costs. European options
have exactly one cash flow at expiration.</p>
<p>A <em>market model</em> specifies <em>prices</em> <span
class="math inline">X_{t}\colon\mathcal{A}_{t} \rightarrow
\mathbf{R}^{I}</span>, and <em>cash flows</em> <span
class="math inline">C_{t}\colon\mathcal{A}_{t} \rightarrow
\mathbf{R}^{I}</span>, where <span class="math inline">I</span> is the
set of available market instruments.</p>
<p>We use the notation <span
class="math inline">X\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathbf{R}</span> to indicate
<span class="math inline">X\colon Ω\to\mathbf{R}</span> is <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span>-measurable. If <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span> is finite then it is generated by
its atoms and <span class="math inline">X</span> <em>is</em> a function
from the atoms of <span class="math inline">\mathcal{A}</span> to <span
class="math inline">\mathbf{R}</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="trading" class="level2">
<h2>Trading</h2>
<p>A <em>trading strategy</em> is a finite collection of strictly
increasing stopping times <span class="math inline">(τ_j)</span>, and
trades <span class="math inline">(\Gamma_j)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_j:\mathcal{A}_{τ_j}\rightarrow
\mathbf{R}^{I}</span> indicating the number of shares to trade in each
instrument at time <span class="math inline">τ_j</span>. Trades
accumulate to a <em>position</em> <span class="math inline">\Delta_t =
\sum_{τ_j &lt; t}\Gamma_j = \sum_{s &lt; t}\Gamma_s</span> where <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_s = \Gamma_j</span> when <span
class="math inline">s = τ_j</span>. A trade at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> is not included in the position at time
<span class="math inline">t</span>; it takes some time for trades to
settle.</p>
<p>The <em>value</em> (or <em>mark-to-market</em>) of a position at time
<span class="math inline">t</span> is <span class="math display">
    V_t = \left( \Delta_t + \Gamma_t \right) \cdot X_t.
</span> This is what you would get from liquidating your existing
position and trades just executed at the current market price.</p>
<p>The <em>amount</em> generated by the trading strategy at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> is <span class="math display">
    A_t = \Delta_t \cdot C_t - \Gamma_t \cdot X_t.
</span> You receive cash flows proportional to your existing position
and pay for the trades just executed.</p>
<section id="example" class="level3">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Consider a two period model with <span class="math inline">T =
\{t_0,t_1,t_2\}</span> with two instruments, a bond and a stock paying
no dividends. Assume the bond price <span class="math inline">R_t =
1</span> and stock price <span class="math inline">S_t = 100</span> are
constant so <span class="math inline">X_t = (R_t, S_t) = (1, 100)</span>
for all <span class="math inline">t</span>. We assume an initial
position <span class="math inline">\Delta_{t_0} = (0,0)</span>. Consider
the trading strategy with <span class="math inline">\tau_0 = t_0</span>,
<span class="math inline">\Gamma_0 = (-100,1)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\tau_1 = t_2</span>, <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_1 = (100, -1)</span>.</p>
<p>We have <span class="math inline">V_{t_0} = \Gamma_0\cdot X_{t_0} =
-100\times 1 + 1\times 100 = 0</span> and <span class="math inline">A_0
= -\Gamma_0\cdot X_0 = -V_{t_0} = 0</span>. The position at time <span
class="math inline">t_1</span> is <span class="math inline">\Delta_{t_1}
= \sum{\tau_j &lt; 1}\Gamma_j = \Gamma_0 = (-100,1)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_t = \Gamma_j</span> when <span
class="math inline">t = \tau_j</span> we have <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_{t_1} = (0,0)</span> so <span
class="math inline">V_{t_1} = (\Delta_{t_1} + \Gamma_{t_1}\cdot X_{t_1}
= 0</span> and <span class="math inline">A_1 = \Delta_{t_1}\cdot C_{t_1}
- \Gamma_{t_1}\cdot X_{t_1} = 0</span>. Note <span
class="math inline">\Delta_{t_2} = -\Gamma_{t_2}</span> so <span
class="math inline">V_{t_2} = 0</span> and <span
class="math inline">A_{t_2} = -\Gamma_{t_2}\cdot X_{t_2} = (100,
-1)\cdot (1, 100) = 0</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose the stock pays a 2 dollar dividend at time <span
class="math inline">t_1</span> so <span class="math inline">C_{t_1} =
(0, 2)</span> is the only nozero cash flow. As above, <span
class="math inline">V_t = 0</span> and <span class="math inline">A_t =
0</span> for all <span class="math inline">t</span> except <span
class="math inline">A_1 = \Delta_{t_1}\cdot C_{t_1} - \Gamma_{t_1}\cdot
X_{t_1} = (-100,1)\cdot (0,2) - 0 = 2</span>. This model is not
arbitrage free.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="arbitrage" class="level2">
<h2>Arbitrage</h2>
<p>Arbitrage exists if there is a trading strategy with <span
class="math inline">A_{τ_0} &gt; 0</span>, <span class="math inline">A_t
\ge 0</span> for <span class="math inline">t &gt; τ_0</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\sum_j \Gamma_j = 0</span>; you make money on the
first trade and never lose until the position is closed out.</p>
<p>The <em>Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing</em> (FTAP) states there
is no arbitrage if and only if there exists a <em>deflator</em>, <span
class="math inline">D_t:\mathcal{A}_t \rightarrow \left(0,\infty
\right)</span>, with <span class="math display">
    X_t D_t = E_t\bigl[X_v D_v + \sum_{t &lt; u \le v} C_u D_u\bigr].
</span> We can assume <span class="math inline">D_0 = 1</span> since if
<span class="math inline">D_t</span> is a deflator then so is <span
class="math inline">D_t/D_0</span>.</p>
<p>Note that if there are no cash flows, <span class="math inline">C_t =
0</span> for all <span class="math inline">t \in T</span>, then <span
class="math inline">X_t D_t</span> is a martingale. For an infinite time
horizon where the price times the deflator goes to 0, the current price
is the expected value of discounted future cash flows, just as in
classical Graham and Dodd valuation.</p>
<p>A consequence of the above using the definitions of value and amount
is <span class="math display">
    V_t D_t = E_t\bigl[V_v D_v + \sum_{t &lt; u \le v}A_u D_u\bigr].
</span> Note the similarity to the previous displated equation. Value
corresponds to price and amount corresponds to cash flow. This is the
skeleton key for valuing derivative securities. It shows how dynamic
trading creates synthetic market instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. If <span class="math inline">u &gt; t</span>
is sufficiently small then <span class="math inline">X_t D_t = E_t[(X_u
+ C_u) D_u]</span> and <span class="math inline">\Delta_t + \Gamma_t =
\Delta_u</span> <span class="math display">
\begin{aligned}
    V_t D_t &amp;= (\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t D_t\\
            &amp;= \Delta_u\cdot E_t[(X_u + C_u) D_u]\\
            &amp;= E_t[(\Delta_u\cdot X_u + \Gamma_u\cdot X_u + A_u)
D_u] \\
            &amp;= E_t[(V_u + A_u)D_u],\\
\end{aligned}
</span> where we use <span class="math inline">\Delta_u\cdot C_u
=  \Gamma_u\cdot X_u + A_u</span>. The displayed formula above follows
by induction.</p>
<p>For a trading strategy that closes out <span
class="math inline">V_{τ_0} D_{τ_0} = E_{τ_0}[\sum_{t &gt;
τ_{0}}{A_{t}D_{t}] \ge 0}</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">V_{τ_0} = \Gamma_{τ_0} \cdot X_{τ_0}</span>, <span
class="math inline">A_{τ_0} = - \Gamma_{τ_0} \cdot X_{τ_0}</span> and
<span class="math inline">D_{τ_0} &gt; 0</span> we have <span
class="math inline">A_{τ_0} \le 0</span>. This proves the “easy”
direction of the FTAP.</p>
<p>There is no need to prove the “hard” direction since we have a large
supply of arbitrage free models. All models of the form <span
class="math inline">X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s \le t}{C_s D_s}</span> where
<span class="math inline">M_t:\mathcal{A}_t \rightarrow
\mathbf{R}^{I}</span> is a martingale and <span
class="math inline">D_t:\mathcal{A}_t \rightarrow (0,\infty)</span> are
arbitrage free. This follows from substituting <span
class="math inline">X_v D_v = M_v - \sum_{u\le v} C_u D_u</span> to
obtain the arbitrage-free condition: <span class="math display">
\begin{aligned}
    E_t\bigl[X_v D_v + \sum_{t &lt; u \le v} C_u D_u\bigr]
        &amp;= E_t\bigl[M_v - \sum_{u\le v} C_u D_u + \sum_{t &lt; u \le
v} C_u D_u\bigr] \\
        &amp;= E_t\bigl[M_v - \sum_{u\le t} C_u D_u \bigr] \\
        &amp;= M_t - \sum_{u\le t} C_u D_u \\
        &amp;= X_t D_t \\
\end{aligned}
</span></p>

<h2>Valuation</h2>
<p>If a derivative security pays amounts <span
class="math inline">\bar{A}_j</span> at times <span
class="math inline">\bar{τ}_j</span> and there is a hedge, <span
class="math inline">(\bar{\Gamma}_t)_{t\in T}</span>, that replicates
these amounts then the value of the derivative is the cost of setting up
the initial hedge: <span class="math inline">\bar{\Gamma}_0\cdot
X_0</span>. The hedge must satisfy <span class="math inline">A_t =
0</span> if <span class="math inline">t ≠ \bar{τ}_j</span> for all <span
class="math inline">j</span> (<em>self financing</em>) and <span
class="math inline">A_t = \bar{A}_j</span> if <span
class="math inline">t = \bar{τ}_j</span> for some <span
class="math inline">j</span>. The formula <span class="math inline">V_0
= E[\sum_j \bar{A}_j D_{\bar{τ}_j}]</span> gives the cost of the initial
hedge since <span class="math inline">V_0 = \bar{\Gamma}_0\cdot
X_0</span>.</p>
<p>European options have a single payment, <span
class="math inline">\bar{A}_T</span>, at a fixed time <span
class="math inline">T</span> and have value <span
class="math inline">V_0 = E[\bar{A}_T D_T]</span>. Sometimes it is
useful to compute this as <span class="math inline">E[\bar{A}_T D_T] =
E^*[\bar{A}_T] E[D_T]</span>, where <span class="math inline">E^*</span>
is the expected value under the probability measure defined by <span
class="math inline">dP^*/dP =
D_T/E[D_T]</span>. This is called the <em>forward measure</em> at time
<span class="math inline">T</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="hedge" class="level2">
<h2>Hedge</h2>
<p>We can compute <span class="math inline">V_0</span> using derivative
cash flows and the deflator. Since <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_0\cdot X_0 = V_0</span> the initial hedge is
<span class="math inline">\Gamma_0 = dV_0/dX_0</span>.</p>
<p>The hedge at time <span class="math inline">t</span> is similarly
determined. Since <span class="math inline">(\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot
X_t = V_t</span> we have <span class="math inline">\Delta_t + \Gamma_t =
dV_t/dX_t</span>, where the last term is the Fréchet derivative. Since
the position <span class="math inline">\Delta_t</span> is known at time
<span class="math inline">t</span> this determines the trades: <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_t = dV_t/dX_t - \Delta_t</span>.</p>
<p>In the continuous time case where stocks are modeled by geometric
Brownian motion, this becomes classical Black-Scholes/Merton delta
hedging where delta is <span class="math inline">\Delta</span> and gamma
is <span class="math inline">\Gamma</span>. Under their mathematical
assumptions the hedge perfectly replicates the derivative.</p>
<p>In the real world it is not possible to perfectly replicate the
derivative security. It is the job of a quant to advise traders on when
to hedge and how to manage the associated risk of imperfect
replication.</p>

<h2>Black-Scholes/Merton</h2>
<p>The Black-Scholes/Merton model of a stock with no dividends (<span
class="math inline">C_t = 0</span> for all <span
class="math inline">t</span>) is specified by the martingale <span
class="math inline">M_t = (r, s\exp(\sigma B_t - \sigma^2t/2))</span>
and deflator <span class="math inline">D_t = \exp(-\rho t)</span>. No
need for Ito’s lemma, partial differential equations, or the Hahn-Banach
theorem.</p>
<p>We can easily add fixed (<span class="math inline">C_j = d_j</span>
constant) or proportional (<span class="math inline">C_j = S_j
p_j</span>) dividends. Stock price “jumping” by dividend amount is a
consequence of the model, not ad hoc no arbitrage arguments.</p>

<section id="canonical-deflator" class="level2">
<h2>Canonical Deflator</h2>
<p>There is a canonical choice for a deflator if repurchase agreements
are available.</p>
<section id="repurchase-agreement" class="level3">
<h3>Repurchase Agreement</h3>
<p>Assume trades occur at discrete times, as they actually do, so <span
class="math inline">T = \{t_j\}</span> where <span
class="math inline">t_i &lt; t_j</span> if <span class="math inline">i
&lt; j</span>.<br />
A <em>repurchase agreement</em> at time <span
class="math inline">t_j</span>, <span class="math inline">R_j</span>,
has price <span class="math inline">X^{R_j}_{t_j} = 1</span> and cash
flow <span class="math inline">C^{R_j}_{t_{j+1}} = R_j</span> so for any
arbitrage free model <span class="math inline">D_{t_j} = E_{t_j}[R_j
D_{t_{j+1}}]</span>. We assume <span
class="math inline">D_{t_{j+1}}</span> is <span
class="math inline">\mathcal{A}_{t_j}</span> measurable so <span
class="math inline">D_{t_j} = R_j D_{t_{j+1}}</span> and <span

R_j^{-1}</span> if <span class="math inline">D_{t_0} = 1</span>.</p>
<p>Define the <em>forward repo rate</em>, <span

\exp(f_j\,\Delta t_j)</span> where <span class="math inline">\Delta t_j
= t_{j+1} - t_j</span>, so <span class="math inline">D_{t_j} =
\exp(-\sum_{j&lt;n} f_j \Delta_{t_j})</span>. The continuous time
version of the <em>canonical deflator</em> is <span
class="math inline">D_t = \exp(-\int_0^t f_s\,ds)</span>.</p>
<p>The price dynamics of all (non-risky) fixed income instruments are
determined by the deflator.</p>
</section>
<section id="futures" class="level3">
<h3>Futures</h3>
<p>Futures contracts are typically traded on exchanges. The exchange
specifies times <span class="math inline">t_j</span> for margin account
adjustments. The price of a futures contract is always 0 for any
exchange customer with a <em>margin account</em> in good standing. Each
contract has an <em>underlying</em> <span class="math inline">S</span>
and an <em>expiration</em> <span class="math inline">T</span>. The
futures <em>quote</em> at time <span class="math inline">t</span>, <span
class="math inline">Φ_t = Φ^{S,T}_t</span>, must satisfy <span
class="math inline">Φ_T = S_T</span>. Prior to that it is determined by
the limit and market orders traded on the exchange. Futures have cash
flows <span class="math inline">C_{t_j} = Φ_{t_j} - Φ_{t_{j-1}}</span>
for <span class="math inline">0 &lt; j \le n</span> and <span
class="math inline">C_{t_0} = 0</span> where <span
class="math inline">t_0</span> is the time the contract is entered.</p>
<p>In an arbitrage-free model <span class="math inline">0 =
E_{t_j}[(Φ_{t_{j+1}} - Φ_{t_j}) D_{t_{j + 1}}]</span> so we have <span
class="math inline">Φ_{t_j} = E_{t_j}[Φ_{t_{j+1}}]</span> since <span
class="math inline">D_{t_{j + 1}}</span> is <span
class="math inline">t_j</span> measurable and non-zero. This shows
futures quotes are martingales, at least at the adjustment times.
Assuming <span class="math inline">Φ_t^{S,T} = E_t[S_T]</span> for all
<span class="math inline">t \le T</span> provides an arbitrage-free
model of futures quotes.</p>

makes the initial value equal to zero: <span class="math inline">0 = V_0
= E[(S_t - f)D_t]</span> so <span class="math inline">S_0 =
fE[D_t]</span>. This formula is called the <em>cost of carry</em>.</p>

<h3>Put-Call Parity</h3>
<p>The first thing every trader checks when using a new model is
<em>put-call parity</em>. A (European) <em>put option</em> on underlying
<span class="math inline">S</span> with strike <span
class="math inline">k</span> expiring at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> pays <span class="math inline">C^p_t =
\max\{k - S_t,0\}</span> at <span class="math inline">t</span>. A
<em>call option</em> on underlying <span class="math inline">S</span>
with strike <span class="math inline">k</span> expiring at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> pays <span class="math inline">C^c_t =
\max\{S_t - k, 0\}</span> at <span class="math inline">t</span>. Since
<span class="math inline">C^c_t - C^p_t = S_t - k</span> we have <span
class="math inline">V^c_0 - V^p_0 = c - p = S_0 - k E[D_t]</span>, where
<span class="math inline">c</span> and <span
class="math inline">p</span> are the value of the call and put at time
0. Put-call parity holds for any (arbitrage-free) model.</p>
<section id="american-option" class="level4">
<h4>American Option</h4>
<p>An American option with strike <span class="math inline">k</span> and
expiration <span class="math inline">t</span> pays <span
class="math inline">C_τ</span> at a stopping time <span
class="math inline">τ\le t</span> at the discretion of the option
holder. In the unified model this is represented by extending the sample
space of the underlying, <span class="math inline">Ω</span>, to <span
class="math inline">Ω\times (0,t]</span>. The outcome <span
class="math inline">(ω,τ)\in Ω\times
(0,t]</span> represents exercising at time <span
class="math inline">τ</span> when <span class="math inline">ω</span>
occurs. Note that the model does not assume the option is exercised at
the “optimal” time. In practice, not every market participant does this.
Models should have knobs that reflect reality and choosing the optimal
stopping time should not be implicit.</p>
<p>American options do not satisfy put-call parity in general. The
exercise time of the put and the call can be different.</p>

<section id="zero-coupon-bond" class="level3">
<h3>Zero Coupon Bond</h3>
<p>A <em>zero coupon bond</em>, <span class="math inline">D(u)</span>,
pays one unit at maturity <span class="math inline">u</span> so <span
class="math inline">C^{D(u)}_u = 1</span> is the only cash flow. We
write <span class="math inline">D_t(u)</span> for the price <span
class="math inline">X_t^{D(u)}</span> of the zero coupon bond at time
<span class="math inline">t</span>. An arbitrage free model requires the
price at time <span class="math inline">t</span> to satisfy <span
class="math inline">D_t(u)D_t = E_t[D_u]</span> so <span
class="math inline">D_t(u) = E_t[D_u]/D_t</span>.</p>
<p>In the continuous time case the forward curve, <span
class="math inline">f(u)</span>, is defined by <span
class="math inline">D_0(u) = \exp(-\int_0^u f(s)\,ds)</span>. The
forward curve at time <span class="math inline">t</span>, <span
class="math inline">f_t(u)</span>, is defined by <span
class="math inline">D_t(u) = \exp(-\int_t^u f_t(s)\,ds)</span>.</p>
<p>A <em>risky zero coupon bond</em> with <em>recovery</em> <span
class="math inline">R</span> and <em>default time</em> <span
class="math inline">T</span> has a single cash flow <span
class="math inline">C_u = 1</span> if default occurs after maturity or
<span class="math inline">C_T = R</span> if <span class="math inline">T
\le u</span>. It is customary to assume <span
class="math inline">R</span> is constant. As with American options, we
must expand the sample space to <span class="math inline">Ω\times
(0,\infty]</span> where <span class="math inline">(ω,t)\in Ω\times
(0,\infty]</span> indicates default occurred at time <span
class="math inline">t</span>. The partition of <span
class="math inline">(0,\infty]</span> representing information available
at time <span class="math inline">t</span> for the default time is <span
class="math inline">\{(t,\infty]\} \cup \{\{s\}:s \le t\}</span>: if
default has not occurred prior to <span class="math inline">t</span> we
only know <span class="math inline">T &gt; t</span>; if default occurred
prior to time <span class="math inline">t</span> we know exactly when it
happened.</p>
<p>We write <span class="math inline">D_t^{R,T}(u)</span> for the price
<span class="math inline">X_t^{D^{R,T}(u)}</span> of the risky zero
coupon bond at time <span class="math inline">t</span>. The dynamics of
a risky zero are determined by <span class="math display">
    D_t^{R,T}(u) D_t = E_t[R 1(T \le u) D_T + 1(T &gt; u) D_u].
</span> The <em>credit spread</em> <span class="math inline">s_t =
s_t^{R,T}(u)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">D_t^{R,T}(u) =
D_t(u) e^{-u s_t}</span> incorporates both recovery and default.</p>
<p>If rates are zero then <span class="math inline">D_t = 1</span> for
all <span class="math inline">t</span> and this simplifies to <span
class="math inline">D_0^{R,T}(u) = R P(T \le u) + P(T &gt; u)</span>
when <span class="math inline">t = 0</span>. If <span
class="math inline">T</span> is exponentially distributed with hazard
rate <span class="math inline">λ</span> then <span
class="math inline">P(T &gt; t) = e^{-λ t}</span> and <span
class="math display">
    D_0^{R,T}(u) = R + (1 - R)e^{-λu}.
</span> When <span class="math inline">λ = 0</span> the right hand side
is 1. When <span class="math inline">R = 0</span> the credit spread
equals the hazard rate. If <span class="math inline">λu</span> is small
then the approximation <span class="math inline">e^x \approx 1 +
x</span> for small <span class="math inline">x</span> gives the rule of
thumb <span class="math inline">s = λ(1 - R)</span> where <span
class="math inline">s = s_0 = s_0^{R,T}(u)</span> is the credit spread
at time 0.</p>
<p>For general <span class="math inline">t</span> we have <span
class="math display">
    D_t^{R,T}(u) = R P(T \le u | T &gt; t) 1(t &lt; T \le u) + P(T &gt;
u | T &gt; t) 1(T &gt; u).
</span></p>
<p>Unlike in the credit default swap market, mathematical finance
literature likes to assume recovery is delayed until maturity. It is
also popular to make the unrealistic assumption that default time is
independent of the deflator. Under these assumptions we have <span
class="math display">
    D_t^{R,T}(u) = D_t(u)\bigl(R P(T \le u | T &gt; t) 1(t &lt; T \le u)
+ P(T &gt; u | T &gt; t) 1(T &gt; u)\bigr).
</span> In principal <span class="math inline">R</span> could be random
and joint distributions involving the default time and deflators could
be specified, but computations become more difficult.</p>
<p>See <a href="fi.html">Fixed Income</a> for details on how the
deflator determines the dynamics of instruments.</p>

<p>The price of an instrument is not a number. Prior to a trade being

<section id="one-period-model" class="level3">
<h3>One-Period Model</h3>
<p>In the one-period model <span class="math inline">T = \{t_0,
t_1\}</span> and we let <span class="math inline">x = X_{t_0}</span>,
<span class="math inline">X = X_{t_1}</span>. The cost of acquiring
<span class="math inline">γ</span> shares of each instrument at the
beginning of the period is <span class="math inline">γ\cdot x</span>. If
that is negative then you make money. At the end of the period you close
the position by selling all of your shares. This results in a cash flow
of <span class="math inline">γ\cdot X</span> to your account. If that is
non-negative then you don’t lose money. A one period model has
<em>arbitrage</em> if there exists <span class="math inline">γ\in
\mathbf{R}^I</span> with <span class="math inline">γ\cdot x &lt;
0</span> and <span class="math inline">γ\cdot X(\omega)\ge0</span>,
<span class="math inline">\omega\in\Omega</span>.</p>
<p>The one-period Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing states that there
is no arbitrage if and only if there exists a positive measure <span
class="math inline">\Pi</span> on <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span> such that <span class="math inline">x
= \int_\Omega X\,d\Pi</span>. If such a measure exists and <span
class="math inline">γ\cdot X\ge 0</span> then <span
class="math inline">γ\cdot x \ge 0</span>, so there is no arbitrage.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> <em>If <span
class="math inline">x\in\boldsymbol{R}^n</span> and <span
class="math inline">C</span> is a closed cone in <span
class="math inline">\boldsymbol{R}^n</span> with <span
class="math inline">x\not\in C</span> then there exists <span
class="math inline">ξ\in\boldsymbol{R}^n</span> with <span
class="math inline">ξ\cdot x &lt; 0</span> and <span
class="math inline">ξ\cdot y \ge0</span> for <span
class="math inline">y\in C</span>.</em></p>
<p>Recall that a <em>cone</em> is a subset of a vector space closed
under addition and multiplication by a positive scalar, that is, <span
class="math inline">C + C\subseteq C</span> and <span
class="math inline">tC\subseteq C</span> for <span class="math inline">t
&gt; 0</span>. For example, the set of arbitrage positions is a
cone.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Since <span class="math inline">C</span> is closed
and convex there exists <span class="math inline">x^*\in C</span> with
<span class="math inline">0 &lt; ||x^* - x|| \le ||y - x||</span> for
all <span class="math inline">y\in C</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">ξ = x^* - x</span>. For any <span
class="math inline">y\in C</span> and <span class="math inline">t &gt;
0</span> we have <span class="math inline">ty + x^*\in C</span> so <span
class="math inline">||ξ|| \le ||ty + ξ||</span>. Simplifying gives <span
class="math inline">t^2||y||^2 + 2tξ\cdot y\ge 0</span>. Dividing by
<span class="math inline">t &gt; 0</span> and letting <span
class="math inline">t</span> decrease to 0 shows <span
class="math inline">ξ\cdot y\ge 0</span>. Take <span
class="math inline">y = x^*</span> then <span class="math inline">tx^* +
x^*\in C</span> for <span class="math inline">t \ge -1</span>. By
similar reasoning, letting <span class="math inline">t</span> increase
to 0 shows <span class="math inline">ξ\cdot x^*\le 0</span> so <span
class="math inline">ξ\cdot x^* = 0</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">0 &lt; ||ξ||^2 = ξ\cdot (x^* - x) = -ξ\cdot x</span>
we have <span class="math inline">ξ\cdot x &lt; 0</span>. <span
class="math inline">\blacksquare</span></p>
<p>The set of non-negative finitely additive measures is a closed cone
and <span class="math inline">X\mapsto \int_\Omega X\,d\Pi</span> is
positive, linear, and continuous so <span class="math inline">C =
\{\int_\Omega X\,d\Pi \mid \Pi\ge 0\}</span> is also a closed cone. The
contrapositive of the FTAP follows from the lemma.</p>
<p>Note that the lemma is a purely geometric fact that does not involve
the actual probability of anything. It is also called Farkas’ lemma and
is a special case of the Hahn-Banach theorem in finite dimensional
space.</p>
<p>The proof also shows how to find an arbitrage when one exists.</p>
<p>If a zero coupon bond exists, i.e., there is a <span
class="math inline">ζ\in\mathbf{R}^I</span> with <span
class="math inline">ζ\cdot X(ω) = 1</span> for all <span
class="math inline">ω\in Ω</span>, then <span class="math inline">ζ\cdot
x = \int_Ω ζ\cdot X\,d\Pi = ||\Pi||</span> is the price of the zero
coupon bond and <span class="math inline">P = Π/ζ\cdot x</span> is a
probability measure. The <em>discount</em> is <span
class="math inline">D = ζ\cdot x</span> and we get the formula <span
class="math inline">x = E[X]D</span> for current price equaling the
expected value of the discounted future price.</p>

### One Period Model Again

Recall the _dual_ of the space of bounded
functions on a set $Ω$, $B(Ω)$, is the space of finitely additive
measures on $Ω$, $ba(Ω)$.
-->
<!-- cite Dunford Schwartz -->
<!--

Let's assume $X_1\in B(Ω,\RR^I)$, the set of bounded functions from
$Ω$ to $\RR^I$. Consider the map $A\colon \RR \oplus B(Ω)\to\RR^2$
defined by $\Gamma \mapsto (-\Gamma\cdot X_0, \Gamma\cdot X_1)$. No arbitrage
says the range of $A$ does not intersect the cone $\{p \oplus P):p > 0, P\ge 0\}$.
Since the cone has an interior point, the Hahn-Banach theorem implies there exists
a hyperplane that does not intersect the cone. The hyperplane is the kernel of
an element in the dual space $B^* = \RR\oplus ba(Ω)$, where
$ba(Ω)$ is the space of finitely additive measures. Call this element
$\pi\oplus\Pi$. We may assume $\pi = 1$.

<p>Let’s start with a brief description of the Simple Unified Model. It
will probably not make much sense on first reading. If you read to the
end and come back again it will make complete sense and seem perfectly
obvious, if I did my job right.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">T</span> be the set of possible trading
times and <span class="math inline">I</span> be the set of tradeable
market instruments. For <span class="math inline">t\in T</span> let
<span class="math inline">X_t</span> be the vector of prices indexed by
<span class="math inline">I</span>, <span class="math inline">C_t</span>
be the vector of cash flows indexed by <span
class="math inline">I</span>. You can buy or sell instruments at prices
<span class="math inline">X_t</span> and receive cash flows <span
class="math inline">C_t</span> proportional to your position in each
instrument at time <span class="math inline">t</span>.</p>
<p>A trading strategy is a finite number of times <span
class="math inline">\tau_0 &lt; \cdots &lt; \tau_n</span> depending on
information available and trading sizes <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_j</span> at time <span
class="math inline">\tau_j</span>. These are vectors indexed by <span
class="math inline">I</span> indicating how much you bought or sold in
each available instrument. Trades accumulate into positions <span
class="math inline">\Delta_t = \sum_{\tau_j &lt; t} \Gamma_j</span>.</p>
<p>The value (mark-to-market) of your position at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> is <span class="math inline">V_t =
(\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t</span>. The amount showing up in your
brokerage account at time <span class="math inline">t</span> is <span
class="math inline">A_t = \Delta_t\cdot C_t - \Gamma_t\cdot
X_t</span>.</p>
<p>Arbitrage is a trading strategy with <span class="math inline">\sum_j
\Gamma_j = 0</span> where <span class="math inline">A_{\tau_0} &gt;
0</span> and <span class="math inline">A_t \ge 0</span> for <span
class="math inline">t &gt; \tau_0</span>. You make money on the first
trade and never loose money until the position is closed.</p>
<p>Every arbitrage-free model of prices and cash flows has the form
<span class="math display">
    X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s\le t} C_s D_s
</span> where <span class="math inline">D_t</span> are positive measures
depending only on information available at time <span
class="math inline">t</span> and <span class="math inline">(M_t)_{t\in
T}</span> is a vector-valued martingale measure indexed by <span
class="math inline">I</span>.</p>
<p>It is trivial to show <span class="math display">
    X_t D_t = (X_u D_u + \sum_{s\in (t, u]} C_s D_s)|_{A_t}
</span> where <span class="math inline">|_{A_t}</span> means given
information at time <span class="math inline">t</span>. It is less
trivial to show <span class="math display">
    V_t D_t = (V_u D_u + \sum_{s\in (t, u]} A_s D_s)|_{A_t}
</span> but this is the skeleton key to pricing derivative instruments.
Note how prices <span class="math inline">X_t</span> correspond to
values <span class="math inline">V_t</span> and cash flows <span
class="math inline">C_s</span> correspond to amounts <span
class="math inline">A_s</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Every trading strategy creates a synthetic market
instrument.</strong></p>
<p>Derivative instruments are specified by a contract. The buyer wants
amounts <span class="math inline">\hat{A}_j</span> at times <span
class="math inline">\hat{\tau}_j</span>. The seller quotes a price and
is obligated to use that to trade available market instruments to
satisfy the contract.</p>
<p>The seller needs to find a trading strategy <span
class="math inline">(\tau_j, \Gamma_j)</span> with <span
class="math inline">A_{\hat{\tau}_j} = \hat{A}_j</span> and <span
class="math inline">A_t = 0</span> otherwise.</p>
<p>The SUM provides an answer for the first trade. Since <span
class="math inline">V_0 = \Gamma_0\cdot X_0</span> the derivative with
respect to initial prices <span class="math inline">X_0</span> is <span
class="math inline">\Gamma_0</span>. It only provide a rigorous
mathematical model for reasoning about the yet unsolved problem of what
subsequent trades you can plausible suggest to traders and risk managers
to convince them you are adding value to their business.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Ros1978">(Ross 1978)</span>
demonstrated how to replace the untenable probabilistic theory of <span
class="citation" data-cites="BlaSch1973">(Black and Scholes 1973)</span>
and <span class="citation" data-cites="Mer1973">(Merton 1973)</span>
with a much simpler and more general geometric theory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If there are no arbitrage opportunities in the capital markets,
then there exists a (not generally unique) valuation operator</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ross showed there is no need for Ito processes or partial
differential equations and also generalized from a bond, stock, and
option to any collection of instruments. There is no need to require a
so-called “real world” probability measure, only to get immediately
thrown out for a “risk neutral” probability measure that is not the
probability of anything. All he needed was the Hahn-Banach theorem: if a
point is not in a convex set then there exists a hyperplane with the
point on one side and the convex set on the other.</p>
<p>Ross made the deleterious assumptions that continuous time trading is
possible and conflated cash flows with jumps in stock price. Assuming
only a finite number of trades are possible, as is the case in our
actual real world, and introducing an explicit variable for cash flows
leads to an even simpler theory.</p>
<p>Every arbitrage free model can be parameterized by a vector-valued
martingale measure and positive adapted measures. These are what Ross
called the valuation operator. We call them deflators. If the model has
repurchase agreements then the deflator is the stochastic discount.</p>
</section>
<section id="math" class="level2">
<h2>Math</h2>
<p>This section collects the mathematical facts required to prove every
arbitrage free model is parameterized by a vector-valued martingale
measure and a deflator.</p>
<p>The vector space of bounded functions on the set <span
class="math inline">S</span> is <span class="math inline">B(S) =
\{f\colon S\to\boldsymbol{R}\mid \|f\| = \sup_{s\in S} |f(s)| &lt;
\infty\}</span>. The vector space dual of <span
class="math inline">B(S)</span> can be identified with <span
class="math inline">ba(S)</span>, the set of finitely additive measures
on <span class="math inline">S</span>.</p>
<p>For any bounded linear functional <span class="math inline">L\colon
B(S)\to\boldsymbol{R}</span> define <span class="math inline">\lambda(A)
= L(1_A)</span> for <span class="math inline">A\subseteq S</span> where
<span class="math inline">1_A(s) = 1</span> if <span
class="math inline">s\in A</span> and <span class="math inline">1_A(s) =
0</span> otherwise. Since <span class="math inline">\lambda(A\cup B) =
L(1_{A\cup B}) = L(1_A + 1_B - 1_{A\cap b} = \lambda(A) + \lambda(B) -
\lambda(A\cap B)</span> and <span class="math inline">\lambda(\emptyset)
= L(1_\emptyset) = L(0) = 0</span> we have <span
class="math inline">\lambda</span> is a finitely additive measure.</p>
<p>For any countably additive measure <span
class="math inline">\lambda\in ba(S)</span> define <span
class="math inline">L\colon B(S)\to\boldsymbol{R}</span> by <span
class="math inline">L(1_A) = \lambda(A)</span>. This can be linearly
extended to linearly to finite linear combinations of characteristic
function. These are uniformly dense in <span
class="math inline">B(S)</span>.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">f\in B(S)</span> define <span
class="math inline">M_f\colon B(S)\to B(S)</span> by <span
class="math inline">M_fg = fg</span> to be the linear operator of
multiplication by <span class="math inline">f</span>. Its adjoint <span
class="math inline">M_f^*\colon ba(S)\to ba(S)</span> defines how to
multiply a finitely additive measure by a bounded function. We write
<span class="math inline">M_f^*(\lambda)</span> as <span
class="math inline">f\lambda</span>.</p>
<p>An algebra of sets on the set <span class="math inline">S</span> is a
collection of subsets closed under union and complement. If the algebra
is finite then its atoms form a partition of <span
class="math inline">S</span>. A partition is a disjoint collection of
subsets of <span class="math inline">S</span> with union <span
class="math inline">S</span> and represents partial information.
Elements of a partition are called atoms. Full knowledge is represented
by the collection of singletons <span class="math inline">\{\{s\}\mid
s\in S\}</span>. No knowledge is represented by the singleton <span
class="math inline">\{S\}</span>. Partial knowledge of <span
class="math inline">s\in S</span> is represented by the atom to which
<span class="math inline">s</span> belongs <span class="math inline">A_s
= \cap\{A\mid s\in A\}</span>.</p>
<p>Conditional expectation can be defined by restriction of measure.
Given a set <span class="math inline">\Omega</span>, an algebra <span
class="math inline">{\mathcal{A}}</span> of sets on <span
class="math inline">\Omega</span>, and a probability measure <span
class="math inline">P</span> on <span
class="math inline">{\mathcal{A}}</span>. If <span class="math inline">Y
= E[X\mid{\mathcal{A}}]</span> is the conditional expectation of <span
class="math inline">X</span>, then <span
class="math inline">Y(P|_{\mathcal{A}}) = (XP)|_{\mathcal{A}}</span>
where the vertical bar indicates restriction.</p>

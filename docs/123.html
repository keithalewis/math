<p>Back when I was interviewing quants I gave them a simple puzzle to
find out if they understood the difference between “real-world” measure
and “risk-neutral” measure. In the mid 90’s most of them gave the
“wrong” answer. By the late 90’s most candidates had been through a
Mathematical Finance program and gave the “right” answer. By that time I
learned from the traders I worked with that the right answer was the
wrong answer. It still does not have an answer that is generally
accepted in the Mathematical Finance world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Suppose a one-period market has a bond with price 1 at the
beginning of the period that goes to price 2 at the end of the period,
and a stock with price 1 at the beginning of the period that goes to
price 1 with probability <span class="math inline">0.1</span> or price 3
with probability <span class="math inline">0.9</span> at the end of the
period. What is the value of a call with strike 2?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are familiar with the Black-Scholes/Merton theory then you
know the price is the expected value of the discounted payoff. The call
has payoff 0 if the stock ends at 1 and payoff 1 if the stock ends at 3.
Since the discount is <span class="math inline">1/2</span> one might
think the value is <span class="math inline">(0(0.1) + 1(0.9))/2 =
0.45</span>. This fails if used on the stock, <span
class="math inline">(1(0.1) + 3(0.9))/2 = 1.4 \not= 1</span>. To reprice
the stock we need <span class="math inline">(1(0.5) + 3(0.5))/2 =
1</span>. This gives the “correct” call price <span
class="math inline">(0(0.5) + 1(0.5))/2 - 0.25</span>.</p>
<p>As B-S/M showed us the “price” of an option is the cost of setting up
a “perfect” hedge. The call can be perfectly hedged for <span
class="math inline">0.25</span>: borrow another <span
class="math inline">.25</span> using the bond and buy <span
class="math inline">0.5</span> in the stock. No matter what, we have to
pay back <span class="math inline">.5</span> on the bond. If the stock
stays at 1 we can sell the stock for <span
class="math inline">0.5</span> to pay off the bond and owe nothing on
the call. If the stock goes to <span class="math inline">3</span> we get
<span class="math inline">1.50</span> from selling the stock, use <span
class="math inline">0.5</span> to pay off the bond, and have <span
class="math inline">1</span> left over to cover the call obligation.</p>
<p>When I was proudly showing off this mathematically correct analysis
to a trader he looked at me as if I had lost my mind. “Wait, wat? I can
give you <span class="math inline">0.25</span> to get back a dollar 90%
of the time? If I have to borrow at 100% interest that is still a
quarter to get half a buck. I’ll take that all day long!”</p>
<p>John Illuzzi pointed out when we were at Banc of America Securities
that he might give a different answer if losing money on a single trade
meant he would be taken out back and shot in the head.</p>
<p>That is when I realized “risk-neutral” meant risk blind. The
mathematical theory did not provide tools traders found useful for
managing risk. Scholes and Merton won Nobel prizes for showing how to
replicate options without knowing the “real-world” growth rate of a
stock. Their assumptions stock price can be modeled by geometric
Brownian motion and it is possible to hedge in continuous time were a
good first approbation.</p>
<p>There have been many theoretical advances to address these
unrealistic assumptions over the past half century, but there is still
no generally accepted answer to an even simpler question.</p>

<p><em>What is the value of an instrument based on a fair coin flip that
pays $1MM if it comes up heads and -$1MM if it comes up tails?</em></p>

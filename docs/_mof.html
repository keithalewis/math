<blockquote>
<p>Much of current academic teaching and research has been criticized for its lack of relevance, that is, of immediate practical impact. … The trouble is caused, however, not by an inadequate selection of targets, but rather by our inability to hit squarely on them, … by the palpable inadequacy of the scientific means with which they try to solve them. … The weak and all too slowly growing empirical foundations clearly cannot support the proliferating superstructure of pure, or should I say, speculative economic theory…. By the time it comes to interpretations of the substantive conclusions, the assumptions on which the model has been based are easily forgotten. But it is precisely the empirical validity of these assumptions on which the usefulness of the entire exercise depends. … A natural Darwinian feedback operating through selection of academic personnel contributes greatly to the perpetuation of this state of affairs.</p>

<p>In Physics when a theory does not fit observation, it is time to come up with a new theory that does. In Mathematical Finance the problems to solve are related to Economics and less tractable. Leontiev won a Nobel prize for his model pioneering work</p>

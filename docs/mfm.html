<p>Mathematical Finance has made Nobel Prize winning advances but there
is more work to be done. Historical mathematical artifacts need to be
replaced by a rigorous theory allowing more faithful modelling of what
happens in the real world.</p>
<!-- What, who happened before. -->
<!-- Why that doesn't work. -->
<!-- Proposed solution. -->
<p>It is time to develop a theory that can model what practitioners
actually do.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>
<p>After the market crash in 1929 the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission">SEC</a>
was established to prevent market manipulation. The first commissoner
was (Joseph Kenedy
Sr)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy_Sr] who established
investor confidence by eliminating fraud and insider information by
establishing regulations requiring companies to make their financial
records public to potential investors.</p>
<p>He was an expert in that having been involved with insider trading at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden,_Stone_%26_Co.">Hayden,
Stone, &amp; Co.</a>, a progenitor to Shearson/American Express.</p>
<p>As with all after-the-fact regulation, this was only partially
successful. Trust is the most valuable commodity in the world. It cannot
be manufactured and can evaporate in an instant.</p>
<p>Inside information a terrific way of making money.</p>

<p>Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future -
Niels Bohr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless you can cheat.</p>
<p>Graham and Todd initiated a systematic and objective analysis of
investments.</p>
<p>Publicly traded companies were required to provide</p>
<p>Markowitz. And Roy. Maximize return, minimize variance. Depends on
historical data. p Cite random variable paper.</p>
<p>Did Graham-Todd agree that Markowitz used market prices to avoid
fundamental research?</p>

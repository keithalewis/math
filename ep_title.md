abstract: |
	The Capital Asset Pricing Model has been known for over 70 years so it may come as a surprise
	there is a much stronger version that has not been previously noticed. 
thanks: |
	Kevin Atteson, Peter Carr, Arnav Sheth, David Shimko, Leon Tatavosian, and Ed Weinberger gave insightful feedback to
	make the exposition more accessible to finance professionals.
	Any infelicities or omissions are my fault.

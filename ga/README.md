# Grassmann Algebra Library

Let \(\{e_0, e_1, \ldots, e_n\}\) be points in Euclidean space
with \(e_i e_j = 0\) if and only if \(i \eq j\) and \(e_0 e_1 \cdots e_n \ne 0\).
The algebra generated by these points is called a Grassmann algebra.
\[
\mathcal{G} = \sum_{j = 0}^n \sum_{0\le i_0 < \cdots < i_j \le n} x_{i_0 \cdots i_j} e_{i_0} e_{i_1} \cdots e_{i_j}
\]

We represent the index set \((i_0, \ldots, i_j)\) as a bitmask of \((n + 1)\)-bits,
where the \(k\)-th bit is 1 if and only if \(k\) is in the index set,

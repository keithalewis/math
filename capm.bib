	abstract = {In an asset market where there are no unexploited arbitrage opportunities, there will exist a linear valuation operator that can unambiguously price return streams with perfect market substitutes or bound values for streams bounded by market combinations. This is possible, without further assumptions, only if the project returns can be duplicated (or bounded) by a deterministic intertemporal program of purchasing a portfolio of marketed assets. These results are proven and used to simplify and unify a number of topics in financial economics, including project valuation, Modigliani-Miller theory, forward pricing, the closed-end mutual fund paradox, and efficient market theories.},

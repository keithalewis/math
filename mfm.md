Mathematical Finance has made Nobel Prize winning advances but there is more work to be done.
Historical mathematical artifacts need to be replaced by a rigorous theory allowing
more faithful modelling of what happens in the real world.


<!-- What, who happened before. -->

<!-- Why that doesn't work. -->

<!-- Proposed solution. -->
It is time to develop a theory that can model what practitioners actually do.

## Review

After the market crash in 1929 the
[SEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission)
was established to prevent market manipulation.  The first commissoner was
(Joseph Kenedy Sr)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy_Sr]
who established investor confidence by eliminating fraud and insider
information by establishing regulations requiring companies to make
their financial records public to potential investors.

He was an expert in that having been involved with insider trading
at [Hayden, Stone, \& Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden,_Stone_%26_Co.),
a progenitor to Shearson/American Express.

As with all after-the-fact regulation, this was only partially successful. 
Trust is the most valuable commodity in the world. It cannot be manufactured
and can evaporate in an instant.




Inside information a terrific way of making money.

Unless you can cheat.

Graham and Todd initiated a systematic and objective
analysis of investments. 

Publicly traded companies were required to provide 

Markowitz. And Roy. Maximize return, minimize variance. Depends on historical data.

Did Graham-Todd agree that Markowitz used market prices to avoid fundamental research?

## Critique

Continuous time.

Implicit assumptions. Optimization. Self-financing.

Lack of knobs.

Bid-ask spread.

Entities.

Dynamic hedging and cash flows.

## The future

Clear trajectory.

Monte Carlo simulation.

Realtime analytics.

Pivot tables. Reporting.

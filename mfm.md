Mathematical Finance has made Nobel Prize winning advances but there is more work to be done.
Historical mathematical artifacts need to be replaced by a rigorous theory allowing
more faithful modelling of what happens in the real world.

## Review

Graham and Todd initiated a systematic and objective analysis of investments.

what stocks would provide reliable returns. Publicly traded companies
were required to provide 

Markowitz. And Roy. Maximize return, minimize variance. Depends on historical data.

## Critique

Continuous time.

Implicit assumptions. Optimization. Self-financing.

Lack of knobs.

Bid-ask spread.

Entities.

Dynamic hedging and cash flows.

## The future

Clear trajectory.

Monte Carlo simulation.

Realtime analytics.

Pivot tables. Reporting.

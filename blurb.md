There is a clear trajectory in mathematical finance starting from Black,
Scholes, and Merton's Nobel Prize winning work demonstrating the value of
an option is the cost of setting up the initial hedge.  Ross showed how
to extend this to any portfolio of instruments in a one-period setting.
Since then, more general option payoffs and multi-period models were
developed to extend theory to more closely align with trading reality.

There are still some basic questions that existing theory cannot answer.
Scholes and Merton won the Nobel prize for showing the initial hedge
does not involve the return on the underlying, only the rate used for
funding the dynamic hedge and the volatility of the underlying instrument.


Perhaps these were obscured by mathematical artifacts due to using
continuous time Brownian motion to model stock prices.
The first question a trader has after putting on an initial
hedge is when, and how much, to adjust that as market prices move.
Current theory has no answer for that. A trader aphorism is
"hedge when you can, not when you have to." They also know

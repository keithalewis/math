There is a clear trajectory in mathematical finance starting from Black,
Scholes, and Merton's Nobel Economic Prize winning work demonstrating
how to replicate an option payoff by delta hedging.
The value of the option is the cost of setting up the initial hedge.
Their Platonic Ideal of a bond, stock, and option with perfect
liquidity and trading in continuous time is evolved to
any collection of instruments and accurately model features
relevant business needs.

Ross showed how to extend this to any portfolio of instruments and should
have won a Nobel Economic Prize for figuring out option valuation does
not require the complicated machinery of Ito processes and partial
differential equations.

Since then, more general option payoffs and multi-period models were
developed to extend theory to more closely align with trading reality.

There are still some basic questions that existing theory cannot answer.
Perhaps these were obscured by mathematical artifacts due to using
a continuous time stochastic process to model stock prices.
Scholes and Merton won a Nobel prize for showing the initial hedge
does not involve the return on the underlying, only the rate used for
funding the dynamic hedge and the volatility of the underlying instrument.

The first question a trader has after putting on an initial
hedge is when, and how much, to adjust that as market prices move.
Current theory has no answer for that. A trader aphorism is
"hedge when you can, not when you have to." They also know

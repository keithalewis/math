Musings on Math

Mathematics deals only with statements that are either true or false.
Although "The quality of mercy is not straind.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath."
is something we can all agree with Shakespeare on, there will never
be a mathematical theory that can prove that is true.

There is no one "true" mathematical theory. There are many mathematical
theories, each with their own truths. In high school we learned Euclid's
axioms of geometry and how to combine them to make more true statements
base on those axioms. Considerable intellectual effort was made to
prove that Euclid's fifth axiom followed from the others.

statement of it is

>     In a plane, given a line and a point not on it, at most one line
parallel to the given line can be drawn through the point.

We now know it doesn't. Their are geometries that satisfy all of Euclid's
other axioms but have no, or infinitly many lines through the point.
It took nearly 2000 years to figure this out. Mathematical knowledge is
hard won, but once it is known it can be built upon.

Human brains evolved to believe whatever parents or tribe, and their
ancestors, told them. If you did not trust what they told you then you
might not have children you could imbue with what you believed.

Religion was invented to take advantage of this trust. Ancient societies
had a special class of sha(wo)men who claimed special access to truth.
Why spend time and effort gathering nuts and berries or doing the hard
work of hunting when you can just make up a story?

Eventually the productive members of society caught on to this ruse and
devised ways of detecting these cheaters, although many still get away
with it to this day. The earliest approches to mathematics focused on the
"soundness" of arguments, an evocative term still used in a technical
sense in modern logic. It is an argument 
based on true premises that is valid. 

Mathematics is following your nose and leads to complications almost
immediately. Most people have the good sense to relegate it to
"Much Ado About Nothing" and can't be bothered with it. I'm not one of those.

When thinking clearly about what "true" and "valid" means it turns out
that "true" is just a convention. There is no absolute truth. Every
mathematical theory starts with axioms: statements that are assumed to
be true in that particular theory. It took some time to figure out that
"valid" arguments can be reduced to mechanical manipulations, starting
with George Boole who showed (propositional) logic can be reduced
to algebra.

Important things got lost along this train of reasoning.
It cannot be be used to give a rigorous meaning to what
a "plausible" argument is. The perview of mathematics
was reducded to _propositions_ that are either "true" or "false."

The vocabulary of propositions is 'not' ($\not$), 'and' ($\wedge$), 'or',  and 'implies'.  
Mathematics is based on common usage of words. If $A$ is true
then not $A$ is false. If $A$ is false then not $A$ is true.
$A$ and $B$ is true only if $A$ and $B$ are true. $A$ or $B$ is true.
but even these lead
to some surprising things when trying to think clearly.

What does 'A implied B' mean? 

Propositions that depend on a _variable_.

Quantification.

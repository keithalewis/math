Musings on Math

Math is about relationships between _statements_/_propositions_.  
It involves following your nose and thinking clearly.  
Following your nose leads to difficulty quite quickly if you think clearly.

Mathematical propositions are either _true_ or _false_.

The vocabulary of propositions is 'and', 'or', 'not', and 'implies'.  
Only need 'nand'. 'If A then B' same as $A => B$.

Propositions that depend on a _variable_.

Quantification.

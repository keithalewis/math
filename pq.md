Why not be a "practical" quant? There are still fundamental and useful
areas of research to focus your considerable talents on.

Black, Scholes, and Merton showed valuing an option assuming the
underlying follows geometric Brownian motion did not depend on the
growth rate but that does not accord with reality, or even prior
theory. Continuous time trading is a mathematical fiction.

If stock price starts gyrating traders will update their estimate
of volatility. If stock price takes off they will go naked on
call options to capture that. Where's the theory for that?

My academic career began as a J. D. Tamarkin assistant professor
of mathematics at Brown before moving on to 10 years as a quant and
technologist at Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley, and Banc of America
Securities.  My consulting firm KALX, LLC was founded in 2002 to
provide quantitative and technical support to hedge funds. The primary
focus was on tools to explore, test, and implement trading strategies.
Unlike large investment banks using arbitrage-free models and the law
of large numbers to manage risk, hedge funds actively look for arbitrage
to exploit.

Peter Carr invited me back to the academic world in 2008.
I have taught Derivative Securities courses as an adjunct at
Columbia, Cornell, Rutgers, and NYU. I was surprised to find
that there was no proof of The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing
accessible at the masters level so I came up with the
the [Unified Model](https://kalx.net/um.pdf).
It can be used to value, hedge, and
manage the risk of portfolios containing *any* collection of instruments.
See [Unified Finance](https://keithalewis.github.io/math/uf.html)
Continuous time trading and perfect liquidity are a mathematical fiction.
Every trading strategy involves a finite number of trades.

Some KALX projects: implemented the initial variance swap pricer for
Bloomberg, ran trade execution (3 years) for a client who figured out
an arbitrage on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, assisted the union (1 year)
representing United-Continental-Continental Micronesia Association of
Flight Attendants, analytics for 

My current work involves tax loss harvesting for municipal bonds at

Hi Ramasastry,

My resume is https://kalx.net/resume.html in case Lester hasn't forwarded it.

He told me the immediate need is an API for what Jerome has developed.

Below are my unexpugated thoughts. Please correct my misunderstandings.

I've worked at Bloomberg as a Senior Software Engineer in their Enterprise
Business and at CrossX as CTO with Andy.  To sell your product you have
to adapt it to potential customers.  No Big Bank is going to write a check
for an API.  You have to build trust with the decision makers writing
checks and have them tell their technology group to make it happen.

If you can get clients, I can be your New York presence that helps you
integrate your software into their production systems.

Best,
Keith

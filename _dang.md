Derivatives are not Great

With apologies to Christopher Hitchens, I do not have a litany of sins
committed by churchs to bolster my strident claims.  The emperor may
not have had clothes, but the Catholic Popes wore full papal regalia while
abetting their clergy to strip children naked and sexually abused them.

My only ammunition is asking embarrassingly simple questions that might
turn the faces of experts in Financial Mathematics bright red.  I count
myself as an apostate member of that tribe who endeavous to shed myself
of unecessarily complicated mathematical ornaments.
Why get angry about
a simple question if you have a simple answer?
Why not use your knowledge and experience to encourage others behind
you to keep advancing the theory?

A derivative is a contract. I will give you this on these dates if you
will give me that on those dates.  Warren Buffet called them "weapons
of financial mass destruction" but portfolio managers at Berkshire
Hathaway trade them every day to manage their risk.  They are a Genie
that cannot be put back in the bottle. They have been employed ever
since Korg promised a bear skin in one week if Grok gave him three arrow
heads tomorrow.  The most valuable commodity in the world is trust. It
cannot be manufactured or bought.  If Korg did not deliver he would be
ostrisiesed by his tribe. Things are more complicated in the modern world

Korg and Grok are now legal entities and ostricism has been replaced by
rule of law as a last resort when trust breaks down.
If you are running a business you must pay attention to the counterparties
you do transactions with and hire lawyers to write contracts that can
be put in front of judges in order to protect yourself from bad actors.
If you have a good lawyer they will write a contract that will
dissuade the lawyer your counterparty hired from going throught that expense.

This is completely out of the realm of current mathematical finance theory.

The New York Fed calculates the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) and
Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR) from daily transaction data reported
under the authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System on the FR 2420 Report of Selected Money Market Rates.

The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) provides a broad measure of
the general cost of financing Treasury securities overnight. The SOFR
includes all trades used in the BGCR plus data on transactions cleared
through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation's Delivery-versus-Payment
(DVP) repo service. In the DVP repo market, counterparties identify
specific securities to settle each trade, rather than a population of
acceptable collateral as in the tri-party repo market.

The New York Fed calculates the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) and
Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR) from daily transaction data reported
under the authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System on the FR 2420 Report of Selected Money Market Rates.


## Vocabulary

BCGR
: The Broad General Collateral Rate (BGCR) is a measure of rates on
  overnight Treasury general collateral repurchase agreement (repo)
  transactions. General collateral repo transactions are those for which
  the specific securities provided as collateral are not identified until
  after other terms of the trade are agreed. The BGCR includes all trades
  in the Tri-Party General Collateral Rate plus GCF Repo transactions

EFFR
: The federal funds market consists of domestic unsecured borrowings in
  U.S. dollars by depository institutions from other depository institutions
  and certain other entities, primarily government-sponsored enterprises.

SOFR
: The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) provides a broad measure
  of the general cost of financing Treasury securities overnight. The SOFR
  includes all trades used in the BGCR plus data on transactions cleared
  through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation's Delivery-versus-Payment
  (DVP) repo service. In the DVP repo market, counterparties identify
  specific securities to settle each trade, rather than a population of
  acceptable collateral as in the tri-party repo market.

TCGR
: The Tri-Party General Collateral Rate (TGCR) is a measure of rates on
  overnight, specific-counterparty tri-party general collateral repurchase
  agreement (repo) transactions secured by Treasury securities. General
  collateral repo transactions are those for which the specific securities
  provided as collateral are not identified until after other terms of
  the trade are agreed.

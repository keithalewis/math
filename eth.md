_Etherium_ is a computer that anyone can use.
Its memory and programs are available to anyone with sufficient storage and computing power.
In order to add data or run a program you must aquire _ether_ to pay for _gas_ charges
to prove to Etherium users that you authorized a change in data or a computation.
If everyone trusted each other there would be no need for Etherium.

The first step is to ask Vitalik for a wallet. You will get a unique id, a public key,
and a private key. If someone acquires your private key they can impersonate you
since the public key is used to identify who is making a transaction.

The second step is to get out your credit card and buy ether from someone who got there
before you. Every Initial Coin Offering is nothing more than a promise from a bankrupt
company. It has no assets. Investors hope people will invest their money and the
value will grow, and be able to liquidate their postion before the value goes back to zero.

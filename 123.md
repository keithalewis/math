Back when I was interviewing quants I gave them a simple puzzle to find out if they
understood the difference between "real-world" measure and "risk-neutral" measure.
In the mid 90's most of them gave the "wrong" answer. By the late 90's most
candidates had been through a Mathematical Finance program and gave
the "right" answer. By that time I learned from the traders I worked with
that the right answer was the wrong answer.

At a recent NYU faculty meeting my colleagues were concerned about the effect
of ChatGPT and other Large Language Models. I use Copilot in the course I
teach there. It is great for generating homework problems. It spits out
incorrect code and the student's assignment is to correct that. It is
a skill they will need to be successful in their future career.

Their worry was the tests they have been developing over the years
would become generally available to students. None of them were
amused by my quip "Keep the same tests, just change the answers."

This is a singular example of that.

> _Suppose a one-period market has a bond with price 1 at the beginning
of the period that goes to price 2 at the end of the period, and a
stock with price 1 at the beginning of the period that goes to price 1
with probability $0.1$ or price 3 with probability $0.9$ at the end of
the period. What is the value of a call with strike 2?_

If you are vaguely familiar with the Black-Scholes/Merton theory then you know the value
is the expected value of the discounted payoff.
The call has payoff 0 if the stock ends at 1 and payoff 1 if the stock ends at 3.
Since the discount is $1/2$ one might think the value is
${(0(0.1) + 1(0.9))/2 = 0.45}$. This fails if used on the stock,
${(1(0.1) + 3(0.9))/2 = 1.4 \not= 1}$. To reprice the stock we need
${(1(0.5) + 3(0.5))/2 = 1}$. This gives the "correct" call price
${(0(0.5) + 1(0.5))/2 - 0.25}$.

As B-S/M showed us the "price" of an option is the cost of setting up a
"perfect" hedge.  The call can be perfectly hedged for $0.25$: borrow
another $0.25$ using the bond and buy $0.5$ in the stock.
No matter what, you have to pay back $0.5$ on the bond. 
If the stock stays at 1 we can sell the stock for $0.5$ to pay off the bond and owe nothing on the call.
If the stock goes to $3$ we get $1.50$ from selling the stock, use $0.5$ to pay off the bond,
and have $1$ left over to cover the call obligation.

When I was proudly showing off this mathematically correct analysis to a
trader he looked at me as if I had lost my mind. "Wait, wat? I can give
you $0.25$ to get back a dollar 90\% of the time? If I have to borrow
at 100\% interest that is still a quarter to get half a buck. I'll take that trade all day long!"

John Illuzzi pointed out, when we were at Banc of America Securities back in the
day when we had to spell bank "banc", he might give
a different answer if losing money on a single trade meant he would be taken
out back and shot in the head.

That is when I realized "risk-neutral" meant risk blind. The mathematical theory
did not provide tools traders found useful for managing risk.
Scholes and Merton won Nobel prizes for showing how to replicate options without
knowing the "real-world" growth rate of a stock. Their assumptions
stock price can be modeled by geometric Brownian motion and it is possible
to hedge in continuous time were not realistic. That had
a deleterious effect on subsequent research.
Instead of coming up with a theory that accurately modeled what traders
do, academics used more math to publish papers trying patch up
a fundamentally flawed theory.

There have been many theoretical advances to address these impractical
assumptions over the past half century, but there is still no generally
accepted answer to an even simpler question.

> _What is the value of an instrument based on a fair coin flip that
pays \$1MM if it comes up heads and -\$1MM if it comes up tails?_

One thing missing from the classical theory is who is offering to back
the (bit?)coin flip and who they can convince, or are willing to allow, to accept it.

Legal entities do trades. There has to be a knob for that in any realistic theory of trading.

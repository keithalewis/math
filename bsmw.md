title: Black-Scholes/Merton is wrong
author: Keith A. Lewis

The theory developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert C. Merton III is wrong.
Not just a little bit wrong, but wrong in a way no Nobel Prize can redeem.
Merton provided a closed-form solution for barrier options
using the reflection principle of Brownian motion.
What is the value of a barrier option that knocks in the second time
the barrier is hit?
It is the same as a barrier option that
knocks in the millionth time it is hit. Don't be like me
and actually say that to a trader. Charlie didn't speak to
me for 3 months after I made that mathematically correct,
but totally foolish claim. I managed to redeem myself
by helping him with some statistics he needed for
his Fantasy Football hobby.

This ridiculouness is a mathematical artifact of Merton learning the Ito
calculus at Cal Tech. It leads to the untenable notion of continuous time
trading. I have been guilty of teaching this nonsence to unsuspecting
students at NYU, Cornell, Rutgers, and Columbia in the derivative
securities I've taught. The way it works in the real world is
traders do only a finite number of trades.

It is time to put an end to this.
